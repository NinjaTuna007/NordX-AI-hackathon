PART ONE

SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS

Article 1

Subject matter and scope

1.  This Guideline sets out the uniform rules for the implementation of the single monetary policy by the Eurosystem throughout the Member States whose currency is the euro.

2.  The Eurosystem shall take all the appropriate measures to implement Eurosystem monetary policy operations in accordance with the principles, tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and procedures laid down in this Guideline.

3.  The legal relationship between the Eurosystem and its counterparties shall be established in appropriate contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB, in which the provisions of this Guideline are implemented accordingly.

4.  The ECB's Governing Council may, at any time, change the tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and procedures for the implementation of Eurosystem monetary policy operations.

5.  The Eurosystem reserves the right to request and obtain any relevant information from counterparties that is needed to carry out its tasks and achieve its objectives in relation to monetary policy operations. This right is without prejudice to any other existing specific rights of the Eurosystem to request information relating to monetary policy operations.

Article 2

Definitions

For the purposes of this Guideline, the following definitions shall apply:

(1) ‘actual/360 day-count convention’ means the convention applied in Eurosystem monetary policy operations which determines the actual number of calendar days included in the calculation of interest by using a 360-day year as the basis;

▼M7

(2) ‘agency’ means an entity that is established in a Member State whose currency is the euro and that either engages in certain common-good activities carried out at national or regional level or serves their funding needs, and which the Eurosystem has classified as an agency. The list of entities classified as agencies shall be published on the ECB's website and shall specify whether the quantitative criteria for valuation haircut purposes set out in Annex XIIa are met in respect of each entity;

▼B

(3) ‘asset-backed securities’ (ABSs) means debt instruments that are backed by a pool of ring fenced financial assets (fixed or revolving), that convert into cash within a finite time period. In addition, rights or other assets may exist that ensure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the holders of the security. Generally, asset-backed securities are issued by a specially created investment vehicle which has acquired the pool of financial assets from the originator or seller. In this regard, payments on the asset-backed securities depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the assets in the underlying pool and other rights designed to assure timely payment, such as liquidity facilities, guarantees or other features generally known as credit enhancements;

(4) ‘bilateral procedure’ means a procedure whereby the NCBs or, in exceptional circumstances the ECB, conduct fine-tuning operations or outright transactions, directly with one or more counterparties, or through stock exchanges or market agents, without making use of tender procedures;

(9) ‘collection of fixed-term deposits’ means an instrument used in conducting open market operations, whereby the Eurosystem invites counterparties to place fixed-term deposits on accounts with their home NCBs in order to absorb liquidity from the market;

5.  The ECB shall initiate open market operations and shall also decide on the terms and conditions for their execution and on the instrument to be used.



CHAPTER 2

Categories of open market operations

Article 6

Main refinancing operations

1.  The Eurosystem shall conduct MROs by means of reverse transactions.

2.  As regards their operational features, MROs:

(a) are liquidity-providing operations;

(b) are normally conducted each week in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations;

(c) normally have a maturity of one week, as indicated in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations, subject to the exception laid down in paragraph 3;

(d) are executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs;

(e) are executed by means of standard tender procedures;

▼M6

(f) are subject to the eligibility criteria laid down in Part Three, which must be fulfilled by all counterparties submitting bids for such operations;

▼B

(g) are based on eligible assets as collateral.

3.  The maturity of MROs may differ on the grounds of varying bank holidays in Member States whose currency is the euro.

4.  The ECB's Governing Council shall decide on the interest rates for the MROs on a regular basis. The revised interest rates shall become effective from the beginning of the new reserve maintenance period.

5.  Notwithstanding paragraph 4, the ECB's Governing Council may change the interest rate for the MROs at any point in time. Such decision shall become effective at the earliest from the following Eurosystem business day.

6.  MROs are executed by means of fixed rate tender procedures or variable rate tender procedures, as decided by the Eurosystem.

Article 7

4.  The Eurosystem may conduct — on a non-regular basis — LTROs with a maturity other than three months. Such operations are not specified in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations.

5.  LTROs with a maturity of more than three months that are conducted on a non-regular basis, as referred to in paragraph 4, may have an early repayment clause. Such an early repayment clause may represent either an option or a mandatory obligation for counterparties under which they repay all or part of the amounts they were allotted in a given operation. Mandatory early repayment clauses shall be based on explicit and predefined conditions. The dates on which the early repayments become effective shall be announced by the Eurosystem at the time of the announcement of the operations. The Eurosystem may decide in exceptional circumstances to suspend early repayments on specific dates on the grounds of, inter alia, bank holidays in Member States whose currency is the euro.

6.  LTROs are executed by means of variable rate tender procedures, unless it is decided by the Eurosystem to execute them by means of a fixed-rate tender procedure. In such a case, the rate applicable to fixed-rate tender procedures may be indexed to an underlying reference rate (e.g. average MRO rate) over the life of the operation, with or without a spread.

Article 8

Fine-tuning operations

1.  The Eurosystem may conduct fine-tuning operations by means of reverse transactions, foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes or the collection of fixed-term deposits, in particular to deal with liquidity fluctuations in the market.

(a) may be conducted either as liquidity-providing or liquidity-absorbing operations;

(b) have a frequency and maturity that depends on the category of open market operation for which they are used;

(c) that fall into the category open market operations are executed by means of standard tender procedures, with the exception of fine-tuning operations, where they are executed by means of tender or bilateral procedures;

(d) that fall into the category marginal lending facility are executed as described in Article 18;

(e) are executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs, without prejudice to Article 45(3).

▼B

5.  Liquidity-absorbing reverse transactions shall be based on assets provided by the Eurosystem. The eligibility criteria of those assets shall be identical to those applied for eligible assets used in liquidity-providing reverse transactions, pursuant to Part Four. No valuation haircuts shall be applied in liquidity-absorbing reverse transactions.

Article 11

Foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes

The revised interest rates shall become effective from the beginning of the new reserve maintenance period, as defined in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). The ECB publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of each calendar year.

7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 6, the ECB's Governing Council may change the interest rate for the standing facilities at any point in time. Such decision shall become effective at the earliest from the following Eurosystem business day.



CHAPTER 1

Marginal lending facility

Article 18

Characteristics of the marginal lending facility

1.  Counterparties may use the marginal lending facility to obtain overnight liquidity from the Eurosystem through a reverse transaction with their home NCB at a pre-specified interest rate using eligible assets as collateral.

2.  The NCBs shall provide liquidity under the marginal lending facility by means of repurchase agreements or collateralised loans under the NCBs' applicable contractual or regulatory arrangements.

3.  There shall be no limit on the amount of liquidity that may be provided under the marginal lending facility, subject to the requirement to provide adequate collateral under paragraph 4.

4.  Counterparties are required to present sufficient eligible assets as collateral prior to using the marginal lending facility. These assets should be either pre-deposited with the relevant NCB or delivered with the request for access to the marginal lending facility.

Article 19

Access conditions for the marginal lending facility

1.  Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 and which have access to an account with the NCB where the transaction can be settled, notably in TARGET2, may access the marginal lending facility.

2.  Access to the marginal lending facility shall be granted only on days when TARGET2 is operational. On days when the SSSs are not operational, access to the marginal lending facility shall be granted on the basis of eligible assets which have already been pre-deposited with the NCBs.

3.  If an NCB or any of its branches are not open for the purpose of conducting monetary policy operations on certain Eurosystem business days due to national or regional bank holidays, the home NCB shall inform its counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the marginal lending facility on that bank holiday.

4.  Access to the marginal lending facility can be granted either based on a specific request of the counterparty or automatically, as specified in paragraph 5 and 6 respectively.

▼M7

5.  A counterparty may send a request to its home NCB for access to the marginal lending facility. Provided that the request is received by the home NCB at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time, the NCB shall process the request on the same day in TARGET2. The deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility shall be postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period. Under exceptional circumstances, the Eurosystem may decide to apply later deadlines. The request for access to the marginal lending facility shall specify the amount of credit required. The counterparty shall deliver sufficient eligible assets as collateral for the transaction, unless such assets have already been pre-deposited by the counterparty with the home NCB pursuant to Article 18(4).

▼B

6.  At the end of each business day, a negative balance on a counterparty's settlement account with its home NCB after finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures shall automatically be considered as a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility. In order to meet the requirement in Article 18(4), counterparties shall have pre-deposited sufficient eligible assets as collateral for the transaction with the home NCB prior to such an automatic request arising. Failure to comply with this access condition shall be subject to sanctions in accordance with Articles 154 to 157.

Article 20

Maturity and interest rate of the marginal lending facility

1.  The maturity of credit extended under the marginal lending facility shall be overnight. For counterparties participating directly in TARGET2, the credit shall be repaid on the next day on which: (a) TARGET2; and (b) the relevant SSSs are operational, at the time at which those systems open.

2.  The interest rate remunerating the marginal lending facility shall be announced in advance by the Eurosystem and shall be calculated as a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention. The interest rate applied to the marginal lending facility is referred to as the marginal lending facility rate.

3.  Interest under the marginal lending facility shall be payable together with repayment of the credit.



CHAPTER 2

Deposit facility

Article 21

Characteristics of the deposit facility

1.  Counterparties may use the deposit facility to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem through the home NCB, to which a pre-specified interest rate shall be applied.

2.  The interest rate applied to the deposit facility may be: (a) positive; (b) set at zero per cent; (c) negative.

3.  The NCBs shall not give any collateral in exchange for the deposits.

4.  There shall be no limit on the amount a counterparty may deposit under the deposit facility.

Article 22

Access conditions to the deposit facility

1.  Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 and which have access to an account with the NCB where the transaction can be settled, notably in TARGET2, may access the deposit facility. Access to the deposit facility shall be granted only on days when TARGET2 is operational.

▼M7

2.  To be granted access to the deposit facility, the counterparty shall send a request to its home NCB. Provided that the request is received by the home NCB at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time, the home NCB shall process the request on the same day in TARGET2. The deadline for requesting access to the deposit facility shall be postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period. Under exceptional circumstances, the Eurosystem may decide to apply later deadlines. The request shall specify the amount to be deposited under the facility.

▼B

3.  Due to the existence of different account structures across the NCBs, the NCBs, subject to the ECB's prior approval, may apply access conditions which are different from those referred to in this Article. The NCBs shall provide information to the counterparties on any such deviations from the access conditions described in this Article.

Article 23

Maturity and interest rate of the deposit facility

1.  The maturity of deposits under the deposit facility shall be overnight. For counterparties participating directly in TARGET2, deposits held under the deposit facility shall mature on the next day on which TARGET2 is operational, at the time at which this system opens.

2.  The interest rate that applies to the deposit shall be announced in advance by the Eurosystem and shall be calculated as a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention.

3.  Interest on the deposits shall be payable on maturity of the deposit. In cases of negative interest rates, the application of the interest rate to the deposit facility shall entail a payment obligation of the deposit holder to the home NCB, including the right of that NCB to debit the account of the counterparty accordingly.

3.  The ECB may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations, if deemed appropriate.

4.  The Eurosystem may select, according to the criteria and procedures specified in Article 57, a limited number of counterparties to participate in quick tender procedures.

Article 28

Execution of standard tender procedures for MROs and regular LTROs, based on the tender calendar

1.  The tender procedures for MROs and regular LTROs shall be executed in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations.

2.  The indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations is published on the website of the ECB and NCBs at least three months before the start of the calendar year for which it is valid.

3.  The indicative trade days for MROs and regular LTROs are specified in Table 7.

Article 29

Execution of tender procedures for fine-tuning and structural operations without a tender operation calendar

1.  Fine-tuning operations are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar. The ECB may decide to conduct fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day. Only NCBs in relation to which the trade day, the settlement day and the reimbursement day are NCB business days participate in such operations.

2.  Structural operations executed by means of standard tender procedures are not performed according to any pre-specified calendar. They are normally conducted and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States whose currency is the euro.



Section 2

Operational steps for tender procedures



Subsection 1

Announcement of tender procedures

Article 30

Announcement of standard and quick tender procedures

▼M4

1.  Standard tender procedures shall be publicly announced by the ECB in advance. In addition, the NCBs may announce standard tender procedures publicly and directly to counterparties, if deemed necessary.

2.  Quick tender procedures may be publicly announced by the ECB in advance. In quick tender procedures that are publicly announced in advance, the NCB may contact the selected counterparties directly if deemed necessary. In quick tender procedures that are not announced publicly in advance, the selected counterparties shall be contacted directly by the NCBs.

▼B

3.  The tender announcement represents an invitation to counterparties to submit bids, which are legally binding. The announcement does not represent an offer by the ECB or the NCBs.

4.  The information to be included in the public announcement of a tender procedure is laid down in Annex II.

5.  The ECB may take any action it deems appropriate to correct any error in the announcement of tender procedures, including cancelling or interrupting a tender procedure under execution.



Subsection 2

Preparation and submission of bids by counterparties

Article 31

Form and place of submission of bids

1.  The bids must be submitted to a counterparty's home NCB. The bids of an institution may only be submitted to the home NCB by one establishment in each Member State whose currency is the euro where the institution is established, i.e. either by the head office or by a designated branch.

2.  Counterparties shall submit bids in a format that follows the templates provided by the NCB for the relevant operation.

Article 32

Submission of bids

1.  In fixed-rate tender procedures, counterparties shall state in their bids the amount that they are willing to transact with the NCBs.

2.  In fixed-rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the counterparties shall state the amount of currency kept fixed that they intend to sell and buy back, or buy and sell back, at that rate.

3.  In variable rate tender procedures, counterparties may submit bids for up to 10 different interest rates, prices or swap points. Under exceptional circumstances, the Eurosystem may impose a limit on the number of bids that may be submitted by each counterparty. In each bid, counterparties shall state the amount that they are willing to transact and the relevant interest rate or price or swap point. A bid for an interest rate or swap point shall be expressed as multiples of 0,01 percentage points. A bid for a price shall be expressed as multiples of 0,001 percentage points.

4.  For variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the counterparties shall state the amount of the currency to be kept fixed and the swap point quotation at which they intend to enter into the operation.

5.  For variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the swap points shall be quoted in accordance with standard market conventions and bids shall be expressed as multiples of 0,01 swap points.

6.  With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the ECB may decide that bids shall be expressed in the form of a price rather than an interest rate. In such cases, prices shall be quoted as a percentage of the nominal amount, with three decimal places.

Article 33

Minimum and maximum bid amounts

1.  For MROs, the minimum bid amount shall be EUR 1 000 000 . Bids exceeding this amount shall be expressed as multiples of EUR 100 000 . The minimum bid amount shall apply to each individual interest rate level.

2.  For LTROs, each NCB shall set a minimum bid amount in the range from EUR 10 000 to EUR 1 000 000 . Bids exceeding the minimum bid amount shall be expressed as multiples of EUR 10 000 . The minimum bid amount shall be applied to each individual interest rate level.

3.  For fine-tuning and structural operations, the minimum bid amount shall be EUR 1 000 000 . Bids exceeding this amount shall be expressed as multiples of EUR 100 000 . The minimum bid amount shall apply to each individual interest rate, price or swap point, depending on the specific type of transaction.

4.  The ECB may impose a maximum bid amount, which is the largest acceptable bid from an individual counterparty, to prevent disproportionately large bids. If imposed, the ECB shall include details of such a maximum bid amount in the public tender announcement.

Article 34

Minimum and maximum bid rate

1.  In liquidity-providing variable rate tender procedures, the ECB may impose a minimum bid rate, which is a lower limit to the interest rate at which counterparties may submit bids.

2.  In liquidity-absorbing variable rate tender procedures, the ECB may impose a maximum bid rate, which is an upper limit to the interest rate at which counterparties may submit bids.

Article 35

Deadline for submission of bids

1.  Counterparties may revoke their bids at any time up to the deadline for the submission of bids.

2.  Bids submitted after the deadline shall not be considered and shall be treated as ineligible.

3.  The home NCB shall determine if a counterparty has complied with the deadline for the submission of bids.

Article 36

Rejection of bids

1.  An NCB shall reject:

(a) all of a counterparty's bids, if the aggregate amount bid exceeds any maximum bid limit established by the ECB;

(b) any bid of a counterparty, if the bid is below the minimum bid amount;

(c) any bid of a counterparty, if the bid is below the minimum accepted interest rate, price, or swap point or above the maximum accepted interest rate, price or swap point.

2.  An NCB may reject bids that are incomplete or do not follow the appropriate template.

3.  If the home NCB decides to reject a bid, it shall inform the counterparty of such decision prior to the tender allotment.



Subsection 3

Tender allotment

Article 37

Allotment in liquidity-providing and liquidity-absorbing fixed-rate tender procedures

1.  In a fixed-rate tender procedure, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:

(a) The bids shall be added together.

(b) If the aggregate amount bid exceeds the total amount of liquidity to be allotted, the submitted bids shall be satisfied pro rata, based on the ratio of the amount to be allotted to the aggregate amount bid, in accordance with Table 1 of Annex III.

(c) The amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.

2.  The ECB may decide to allot:

(a) a minimum allotment amount, which is a lower limit on the amount that may be allotted to each bidder; or

(b) a minimum allotment ratio, which is a lower limit, expressed in percentage terms, on the ratio of bids at the marginal interest rate that may be allotted to each bidder.

Article 38

Allotment in liquidity-providing variable rate tender procedures in euro

1.  In a liquidity-providing variable rate tender procedure in euro, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:

(a) Bids shall be listed in descending order of offered interest rates or ascending order of offered prices.

(b) Bids with the highest interest rate (lowest price) levels shall be satisfied first and subsequently bids with successively lower interest rates (higher price) shall be accepted, until the total liquidity to be allotted is exhausted.

(c) If at the marginal interest rate (highest accepted price), the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted, the remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal interest rate (highest accepted price), in accordance with Table 2 of Annex III.

(d) The amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.

2.  The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.

Article 39

Allotment in liquidity-absorbing variable rate tender procedures in euro

1.  In a liquidity-absorbing variable rate tender procedure in euro, used for the issuance of ECB debt certificates and the collection of fixed term deposits, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:

(a) Bids shall be listed in ascending order of offered interest rates or descending order of offered prices.

(b) Bids with the lowest interest rate (highest price) levels shall be satisfied first and subsequently bids with successively higher interest rates (lower price bids) shall be accepted until the total liquidity to be absorbed is exhausted.

(c) If at the marginal interest rate (lowest accepted price), the aggregate bid amount exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted, the remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids, based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total bid amount at the marginal interest rate (lowest accepted price), in accordance with Table 2 of Annex III.

(d) The amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro. With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the allotted nominal amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of EUR 100 000 .

2.  The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.

Article 40

Allotment in liquidity-providing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures

1.  In a liquidity-providing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedure, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:

(a) Bids shall be listed in ascending order of swap point quotations by taking into account the sign of the quotation.

(b) The sign of quotation depends on the sign of the interest rate differential between the foreign currency and the euro. For the maturity of the swap:

(i) if the foreign currency interest rate is higher than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is positive, i.e. the euro is quoted at a premium to the foreign currency; and

(ii) if the foreign currency interest rate is lower than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is negative, i.e. the euro is quoted at a discount to the foreign currency.

(c) The bids with the lowest swap point quotations shall be satisfied first and subsequently successively higher swap point quotations shall be accepted until the total amount of the fixed currency to be allotted is exhausted.

(d) If, at the highest swap point quotation accepted, i.e. the marginal swap point quotation, the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted, the remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids, based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation, in accordance with Table 3 of Annex III.

(e) The amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.

2.  The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.

Article 41

Allotment in liquidity-absorbing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures

1.  In a liquidity-absorbing variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedure, the bids of counterparties shall be allotted in the following manner:

(a) Bids shall be listed in descending order of offered swap point quotations by taking into account the sign of the quotation.

(b) The sign of the quotation depends on the sign of the interest rate differential between the foreign currency and the euro. For the maturity of the swap:

(i) if the foreign currency interest rate is higher than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is positive, i.e. the euro is quoted at a premium to the foreign currency; and

(ii) if the foreign currency interest rate is lower than the corresponding interest rate for the euro, the swap point quotation is negative, i.e. the euro is quoted at a discount to the foreign currency.

(c) Bids with the highest swap point quotations shall be satisfied first and subsequently successively lower swap point quotations shall be accepted until:

(i) the total amount of the fixed currency to be absorbed is exhausted; and

(ii) at the lowest swap point quotation accepted, i.e. the marginal swap point quotation, the aggregate amount bid exceeds the remaining amount to be allotted.

(d) The remaining amount shall be allocated pro rata among the bids, based on the ratio of the remaining amount to be allotted to the total amount bid at the marginal swap point quotation, in accordance with Table 3 of Annex III. The amount allotted to each counterparty shall be rounded to the nearest euro.

2.  The ECB may decide to allot a minimum allotment amount to each successful bidder.

Article 42

Type of auction for variable rate tender procedures

For variable rate tender procedures, the Eurosystem may apply either a single rate auction (Dutch auction) or multiple rate auction (American auction).



Subsection 4

Announcement of tender results

Article 43

Announcement of tender results

▼M4

1.  The ECB shall publicly announce its tender allotment decision with respect to the tender results. In addition, the NCBs may announce the ECB's tender allotment decision publicly and directly to counterparties if they deem it necessary.

▼B

2.  The information to be included in the public announcement with respect to the tender results is laid down in Annex IV.

3.  If the allotment decision contains erroneous information with respect to any of the information contained in the public tender result announcement referred to in paragraph 1, the ECB may take any action it deems appropriate to correct such erroneous information.

4.  After the public announcement of the ECB's tender allotment decision on the tender results as referred to in paragraph 1, the NCBs shall directly certify the individual allotment results to counterparties, whereby each counterparty shall receive an individual and certain confirmation of its success in the tender procedure and the exact amount allotted to it.



Section 3

Bilateral procedures for Eurosystem open market operations

Article 44

Overview of bilateral procedures

1.  The Eurosystem may execute any of the following open market operations by means of bilateral procedures:

(a) fine-tuning operations (reverse transactions, foreign exchange swaps or the collection of fixed-term deposits); or

(b) structural operations (outright transactions).

2.  Bilateral procedures, depending on the specific transaction, may be executed by means of direct contact with counterparties, as laid down in Article 45, or through stock exchanges and market agents, as laid down in Article 46.

Article 45

Bilateral procedures executed by means of direct contact with counterparties

1.  Bilateral procedures for fine-tuning operations and structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions may be executed by means of direct contact with counterparties.

2.  The NCBs shall directly contact one or more institutions selected in accordance with the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 57. The NCBs shall follow the ECB's instructions in deciding whether to enter into a transaction with those institutions.

3.  Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the ECB's Governing Council may decide that, under exceptional circumstances, the ECB or one or more NCBs, acting as the ECB's operating arm, shall conduct fine-tuning operations or structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions executed through bilateral procedures. In such an event, the procedures for those operations shall be adapted accordingly. The ECB shall decide whether to enter into a transaction with the contacted institutions.

Article 46

Bilateral procedures executed by means of stock exchanges and market agents

1.  Without prejudice to Article 45, bilateral procedures for structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions may be executed through stock exchanges and market agents.

2.  The range of counterparties shall not be restricted, as provided for in Article 57.

3.  The procedures shall be adapted to the market conventions for the debt instruments transacted.

Article 47

Announcement of operations executed by means of bilateral procedures

1.  Fine-tuning operations or structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions executed by means of bilateral procedures are not announced publicly in advance, unless the ECB decides otherwise.

2.  The ECB may decide not to announce the results of such bilateral procedures publicly.

Article 48

Operating days for bilateral procedures

1.  The ECB may decide to conduct bilateral procedures for fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day. Only NCBs in relation to which the trade day, the settlement day and the reimbursement day are NCB business days may participate in such operations.

2.  Bilateral procedures for structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions are normally executed and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States whose currency is the euro.



CHAPTER 2

Settlement procedures for Eurosystem monetary policy operations

Article 49

Overview of settlement procedures

1.  Payment orders relating to the participation in open market operations or use of the standing facilities shall be settled on the counterparties' accounts with an NCB or on the accounts of a settlement bank participating in TARGET2.

2.  Payment orders relating to the participation in open market liquidity-providing operations or use of the marginal lending facility shall only be settled at the moment of or after the final transfer of the eligible assets as collateral to the operation. For this purpose, counterparties shall:

(a) pre-deposit the eligible assets at an NCB; or

(b) settle the eligible assets with an NCB on a delivery-versus-payment basis.

Article 50

Settlement of open market operations

1.  The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle transactions related to its open market operations at the same time in all Member States whose currency is the euro with all counterparties that have provided sufficient eligible assets as collateral. However, owing to operational constraints and technical features (e.g. of SSSs), the timing within the day of the settlement of open market operations may differ across the Member States whose currency is the euro.

2.  The indicative settlement dates are summarised in Table 8.

1.  The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures, on the first day following the trade day on which TARGET2 and all relevant SSSs are open.

2.  The settlement dates for MROs and regular LTROs are specified in advance in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations. If the normal settlement date coincides with a bank holiday, the ECB may decide to apply a different settlement date, with the option of same-day settlement. The Eurosystem shall endeavour to ensure that the time of settlement of MROs and regular LTROs coincides with the time of reimbursement of a previous operation of corresponding maturity.

3.  The issuance of ECB debt certificates shall be settled on the second day following the trade day on which TARGET2 and all relevant SSSs are open.

Article 52

Settlement of open market operations conducted by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures

1.  The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures and bilateral procedures on the trade day. Other settlement dates may be applied, in particular for outright transactions and foreign exchange swaps.

Article 53

Further provisions relating to settlement and end-of-day procedures

1.  Without prejudice to the requirements laid down in this Chapter, additional provisions relating to settlement may be laid down in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the NCBs, or the ECB, for the specific monetary policy instrument.

2.  The end-of-day procedures are specified in the documentation relating to the TARGET2 framework.

Article 54

Reserve holdings and excess reserves

1.  Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), a counterparty's settlement account with an NCB may be used as a reserve account. Reserve holdings on settlement accounts may be used for intraday settlement purposes. The daily reserve holding of a counterparty shall be calculated as the end-of-day balance on its reserve account. For the purposes of this Article, ‘reserve account’ shall have the same meaning as that in Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).

2.  Reserve holdings that exceed the minimum reserves required pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) shall be remunerated at zero per cent or the deposit facility rate, whichever is lower.



PART THREE

ELIGIBLE COUNTERPARTIES

▼M6

Article 55

Eligibility criteria for participation in Eurosystem monetary policy operations

With regard to Eurosystem monetary policy operations, subject to Article 57, the Eurosystem shall only allow participation by institutions that fulfil the following criteria:

(a) they shall be subject to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system pursuant to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB and shall not have been granted an exemption from their obligations under the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9);

(b) they shall be one of the following:

(i) subject to at least one form of harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

(ii) publicly owned credit institutions, within the meaning of Article 123(2) of the Treaty, subject to supervision of a standard comparable to supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

(iii) institutions subject to non-harmonised supervision by competent authorities of a standard comparable to harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, e.g. branches established in Member States whose currency is the euro of institutions incorporated outside the EEA. For the purpose of assessing an institution's eligibility to participate in Eurosystem monetary policy operations, as a rule, non-harmonised supervision shall be considered to be of a standard comparable to harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, if the relevant Basel III standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are considered to have been implemented in the supervisory regime of a given jurisdiction;

(c) they must be financially sound within the meaning of Article 55a;

(d) they shall fulfil all operational requirements specified in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB or ECB with respect to the specific instrument or operation.

▼M2

Article 55a

Assessment of the financial soundness of institutions

1.  In its assessment of the financial soundness of individual institutions for the purposes of this Article, the Eurosystem may take into account the following prudential information:

(a) quarterly information on capital, leverage and liquidity ratios reported under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on an individual and consolidated basis, in accordance with the supervisory requirements; or

(b) where applicable, prudential information of a standard comparable to information under point (a).

2.  If such prudential information is not made available to an institution's home NCB and the ECB by the institution's supervisor, either the home NCB or the ECB may require the institution to make such information available. When such information is provided directly by an institution, the institution shall also submit an assessment of the information carried out by the relevant supervisor. An additional certification from an external auditor may also be required.

▼M4

3.  In the case of branches, the information reported under paragraph 1 shall relate to the institution to which the branch belongs.

▼M2

4.  As regards the assessment of the financial soundness of institutions that have been subject to in-kind recapitalisation with public debt instruments, the Eurosystem may take into account the methods used for and the role played by such in-kind recapitalisations, including the type and liquidity of such instruments and the market access of the issuer of such instruments, in ensuring the fulfilment of the capital ratios reported under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

▼M5

5.  A wind-down entity shall not be eligible to access Eurosystem monetary policy operations unless it has been accepted as an eligible counterparty to participate in Eurosystem monetary policy operations by 22 March 2017. In that case it shall remain eligible until 31 December 2021, with the limitation that its access to Eurosystem credit operations, as defined in point (31) of Article 2, shall be capped at the average level of its recourse to Eurosystem credit operations during the 12-month period preceding 22 March 2017 with the possibility to compute and apply such cap jointly for a number of wind-down entities belonging to the same group, where relevant. Thereafter, such a wind-down entity shall no longer be eligible to access Eurosystem monetary policy operations.

▼B

Article 56

Access to open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures and to standing facilities

1.  Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 shall have access to any of the following Eurosystem monetary policy operations:

(a) standing facilities;

(b) open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures.

2.  Access to the standing facilities or open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures shall only be granted to institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 through their home NCB.

3.  Where an institution fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 has establishments, e.g. head office or branches, in more than one Member State whose currency is the euro, each establishment fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 may access the standing facilities or the open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures through its home NCB.

4.  Bids for open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures and for recourse to the standing facilities shall be submitted by only one establishment in each Member State whose currency is the euro, i.e. either by the head office or by a designated branch.

Article 57

Selection of counterparties for access to open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures

1.  For open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, counterparties shall be selected in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 4.

2.  For structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions that are executed by means of bilateral procedures, there shall be no restriction on the range of counterparties. For structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions, which are executed by means of quick tender procedures, the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 57(3)(b) shall apply.

3.  For fine-tuning operations that are executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, counterparties shall be selected as follows:

(a) For fine-tuning operations that are conducted by means of foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes and executed by means of quick tender or bilateral procedures, the range of counterparties shall be identical to the range of entities that are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations and are established in the Member States whose currency is the euro. Counterparties for foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes by means of quick tender or bilateral procedures do not need to fulfil the criteria laid down in Article 55. The selection criteria for counterparties participating in Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations are based on the principles of prudence and efficiency, as laid down in Annex V. The NCBs may apply limit-based systems in order to control credit exposures vis-à-vis individual counterparties participating in foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes.

(b) For fine-tuning operations conducted by means of reverse transactions or through the collection of fixed-term deposits and executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, each NCB shall select, for a specific transaction, a set of counterparties from among the institutions that fulfil the eligibility criteria laid down in Article 55 and are established in its Member State whose currency is the euro. The selection shall be primarily based on the relevant institution's activity in the money market. Additional selection criteria may be applied by the NCB, such as the efficiency of the trading desk and the bidding potential.

4.  If the ECB's Governing Council, pursuant to Article 45(3), decides that the ECB shall conduct, by itself or by means of one or more NCBs fine-tuning operations executed by means of bilateral procedures, the ECB shall select its counterparties in accordance with a rotation scheme among the counterparties that are eligible to participate in quick tender procedures and bilateral procedures.

5.  Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 4, open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures may also be conducted with a broader range of counterparties than those indicated in paragraphs 2 to 4, if the ECB's Governing Council so decides.



PART FOUR

ELIGIBLE ASSETS



TITLE I

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Article 58

Eligible assets and accepted collateralisation techniques to be used for Eurosystem credit operations

1.  The Eurosystem shall apply a single framework for eligible assets common to all Eurosystem credit operations as laid down in this Guideline.

2.  In order to participate in Eurosystem credit operations, counterparties shall provide the Eurosystem with assets that are eligible as collateral for such operations. Given that Eurosystem credit operations include intraday credit, collateral provided by counterparties in respect of intraday credit shall also comply with the eligibility criteria laid down in this Guideline, as outlined in Guideline ECB/2012/27.

3.  Counterparties shall provide eligible assets by:

(a) the transfer of ownership, which takes the legal form of a repurchase agreement; or

(b) the creation of a security interest, i.e. a pledge, assignment or a charge granted over the relevant assets, which takes the legal form of a collateralised loan,

in either case pursuant to the national contractual or regulatory arrangements established and documented by the home NCB.

4.  Where counterparties provide eligible assets as collateral, the home NCB may require either earmarking or pooling of eligible assets, depending on which type of collateral management system it uses.

5.  No distinction shall be made between marketable and non-marketable assets with regard to the quality of the assets and their eligibility for the various types of Eurosystem credit operations.

6.  Without prejudice to the obligation in paragraph 2 that counterparties provide the Eurosystem with assets that are eligible as collateral, the Eurosystem may, upon request, provide counterparties with advice regarding the eligibility of marketable assets if they have already been issued or regarding the eligibility of non-marketable assets when they have already been requested for submission. The Eurosystem shall not provide any advice in advance of these events.

Article 59

General aspects of the Eurosystem credit assessment framework for eligible assets

1.  As one of the criteria for eligibility, assets shall meet the high credit standards specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF).

2.  The ECAF shall lay down the procedures, rules and techniques to ensure that the Eurosystem's requirement for high credit standards for eligible assets is maintained and that eligible assets comply with the credit quality requirements defined by the Eurosystem.

3.  For the purposes of the ECAF, the Eurosystem shall define credit quality requirements in the form of credit quality steps by establishing threshold values for the probability of default (PD) over a one-year horizon, as follows.

(a) The Eurosystem considers, subject to regular review, a maximum probability of default over a one-year horizon of 0,10 % as equivalent to the credit quality requirement of credit quality step 2 and a maximum probability of default over a one-year horizon of 0,40 % as equivalent to the credit quality requirement of credit quality step 3.

(b) All eligible assets for Eurosystem credit operations shall comply, as a minimum, with a credit quality requirement corresponding to credit quality step 3. Additional credit quality requirements for specific assets shall be applied by the Eurosystem in accordance with Titles II and III of Part Four.

▼M7

4.  The Eurosystem shall publish information on credit quality steps on the ECB's website in the form of the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale, including the mapping of credit assessments, provided by the accepted external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs), to credit quality steps.

5.  In the assessment of the credit quality requirements, the Eurosystem takes into account credit assessment information from credit assessment systems belonging to one of the three sources in accordance with Title V of Part Four.

▼B

6.  As part of its assessment of the credit standard of a specific asset, the Eurosystem may take into account institutional criteria and features ensuring similar protection for the asset holder, such as guarantees. The Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements on the basis of any information that the Eurosystem may consider relevant for ensuring adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem.

7.  The ECAF follows the definition of ‘default’ laid down in Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.



TITLE II

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND CREDIT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETABLE ASSETS



CHAPTER 1

Eligibility criteria for marketable assets

Article 60

Eligibility criteria relating to all types of marketable assets

In order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, marketable assets shall be debt instruments fulfilling the eligibility criteria laid down in Section 1, except in the case of certain specific types of marketable assets, as laid down in Section 2.

Article 61

List of eligible marketable assets and reporting rules

▼M6

1.  The ECB shall publish an updated list of eligible marketable assets on its website, in accordance with the methodologies indicated on its website and shall update it every day on which TARGET2 is operational. Marketable assets included on the list of eligible marketable assets become eligible for use in Eurosystem credit operations upon their publication on the list. As an exception to this rule, in the specific case of debt instruments with same-day value settlement, the Eurosystem may grant eligibility from the date of issue. Assets assessed in accordance with Article 87(3) shall not be published on this list of eligible marketable assets.

▼B

2.  As a rule, the NCB reporting a specific marketable asset to the ECB is the NCB of the country in which the marketable asset is admitted to trading.



Section 1

General eligibility criteria for marketable assets

Article 62

Principal amount of marketable assets

1.  In order to be eligible, until their final redemption, debt instruments shall have:

(a) a fixed and unconditional principal amount; or

(b) an unconditional principal amount that is linked, on a flat basis, to only one euro area inflation index at a single point in time, containing no other complex structures.

2.  Debt instruments with a principal amount linked to only one euro area inflation index at a single point in time shall also be permissible, given that the coupon structure is as defined in Article 63(1)(b)(i) fourth indent and linked to the same euro area inflation index.

3.  Assets with warrants or similar rights attached shall not be eligible.

▼M1

Article 63

Acceptable coupon structures for marketable assets

▼M4

1.  In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall have either of the following coupon structures until final redemption:

(a) fixed, zero or multi-step coupons with a pre-defined coupon schedule and pre-defined coupon values; or

(b) floating coupons that have the following structure: coupon rate = (reference rate * l) ± x, with f ≤ coupon rate ≤ c, where:

(i) the reference rate is only one of the following at a single point in time:

— a euro money market rate, e.g. Euribor, LIBOR or similar indices,

— a constant maturity swap rate, e.g. CMS, EIISDA, EUSA,

— the yield of one or an index of several euro area government bonds that have a maturity of one year or less,

— a euro area inflation index;

(ii) f (floor), c (ceiling), l (leveraging/deleveraging factor) and x (margin) are, if present, numbers that are either pre-defined at issuance, or may change over time only according to a path predefined at issuance, where l is greater than zero throughout the entire lifetime of the asset. For floating coupons with an inflation index reference rate, l shall be equal to one.

▼M1

2.  Any coupon structure that does not comply with paragraph 1 shall not be eligible, including instances where only part of the remuneration structure, such as a premium, is non-compliant.

3.  For the purpose of this Article, if the coupon is either of a fixed multi-step type or of a floating multi-step type, the assessment of the relevant coupon structure shall be based on the entire lifetime of the asset with both a forward- and backward-looking perspective.

4.  Acceptable coupon structures shall have no issuer optionalities, i.e. during the entire lifetime of the asset, based on a forward- and backward-looking perspective, changes in the coupon structure that are contingent on an issuer's decision shall not be acceptable.

▼B

Article 64

Non-subordination with respect to marketable assets

Eligible debt instruments shall not give rise to rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to the rights of holders of other debt instruments of the same issuer.

Article 65

Currency of denomination of marketable assets

In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of the Member States whose currency is the euro.

Article 66

Place of issue of marketable assets

▼M6

1.  Subject to paragraph 2, in order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued in the EEA with a central bank or with an eligible SSS.

▼B

2.  In respect of debt instruments issued or guaranteed by a non-financial corporation for which no credit assessment has been provided by an accepted ECAI system for the issue, issuer or guarantor, the place of issue must be within the euro area.

▼M6

3.  International debt instruments issued through the ICSDs shall comply with the following criteria, as applicable.

(a) International debt instruments issued in global bearer form shall be issued in the form of new global notes (NGNs) and shall be deposited with a common safekeeper which is an ICSD or a CSD that operates an eligible SSS. This requirement shall not apply to international debt instruments issued in global bearer form issued in the form of classical global notes prior to 1 January 2007 and fungible tap issuances of such notes issued under the same ISIN irrespective of the date of the tap-issuance.

(b) International debt instruments issued in global registered form shall be issued under the new safekeeping structure for international debt instruments. By way of derogation, this shall not apply to international debt instruments issued in global registered form prior to 1 October 2010.

(c) International debt instruments in individual note form shall not be eligible unless they were issued in individual note form prior to 1 October 2010.

▼B

Article 67

Settlement procedures for marketable assets

▼M6

1.  In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be transferable in book-entry form and shall be held and settled in Member States whose currency is the euro through an account with an NCB or with an eligible SSS, so that the perfection and realisation of collateral is subject to the law of a Member State whose currency is the euro.

▼M6

1a.  In addition, where the use of such debt instruments involves tri-party collateral management services, on a domestic and/or cross-border basis, those services shall be provided by a tri-party agent that has been positively assessed pursuant to the ‘Eurosystem standards for the use of triparty agents (TPAs) in Eurosystem credit operations’, which are published on the ECB's website.

▼M6

2.  If the CSD where the asset is issued and the CSD where the asset is held are not identical, the SSSs operated by these two CSDs must be connected by an eligible link in accordance with Article 150.

▼B

Article 68

Acceptable markets for marketable assets

1.  In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be those which are admitted to trading on a regulated market as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 12 ), or admitted to trading on certain acceptable non-regulated markets.

2.  The ECB shall publish the list of acceptable non-regulated markets on its website and shall update it at least once a year.

3.  The assessment of non-regulated markets by the Eurosystem shall be based on the following principles of safety, transparency and accessibility.

(a) Safety refers to certainty with regard to transactions, in particular certainty in relation to the validity and enforceability of transactions.

(b) Transparency refers to unimpeded access to information on the market's rules of procedure and operation, the financial features of the assets, the price formation mechanism, and the relevant prices and quantities, e.g. quotes, interest rates, trading volumes, outstanding amounts.

(c) Accessibility refers to the ability of the Eurosystem to take part in and access the market. A market is considered accessible if its rules of procedure and operation allow the Eurosystem to obtain information and conduct transactions when needed for collateral management purposes.

4.  The selection process for non-regulated markets shall be defined exclusively in terms of the performance of the Eurosystem collateral management function and should not be regarded as an assessment by the Eurosystem of the intrinsic quality of any market.

Article 69

Type of issuer or guarantor for marketable assets

▼M6

1.  In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued or guaranteed by central banks of Member States, public sector entities, agencies, credit institutions, financial corporations other than credit institutions, non-financial corporations, multilateral development banks or international organisations. For marketable assets with more than one issuer, this requirement shall apply to each issuer.

▼M7 —————

▼M6

3.  Debt instruments issued or guaranteed by investment funds shall be ineligible.

▼B

Article 70

Place of establishment of the issuer or guarantor

▼M6

1.  In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued by an issuer established in the EEA or in a non-EEA G10 country, subject to the exceptions in paragraphs 3 to 6 of this Article and in paragraph 4 of Article 81a. For marketable assets with more than one issuer, this requirement shall apply to each issuer.

▼B

2.  In order to be eligible, guarantors of debt instruments shall be established in the EEA, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for specific debt instruments, subject to the exceptions laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4. The possibility to use an ECAI guarantor rating to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for specific debt instruments is laid down in Article 84.

3.  For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by non-financial corporations for which no credit assessment from an accepted ECAI system exists for the issue, the issuer or the guarantor, the issuer or guarantor shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.

▼M7

3a.  For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by agencies, the issuer or guarantor shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.

▼B

4.  For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by multilateral development banks or international organisations, the criterion in respect of place of establishment shall not apply and they shall be eligible irrespective of their place of establishment.

5.  For asset-backed securities, the issuer must be established in the EEA in accordance with Article 74.

6.  Debt instruments issued by issuers established in non-EEA G10 countries shall only be considered eligible if the Eurosystem has ascertained to its satisfaction that its rights would be protected in an appropriate manner under the laws of the relevant non-EEA G10 country. For this purpose, a legal assessment shall be submitted to the relevant NCB, in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem, before the relevant debt instruments may be considered eligible.

Article 71

Credit quality requirements for marketable assets

In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall meet the credit quality requirements specified in Chapter 2, except where otherwise stated.



Section 2

Specific eligibility criteria for certain types of marketable assets



Subsection 1

Specific eligibility criteria for asset-backed securities

Article 72

Eligibility criteria for asset-backed securities

In order to be eligible for Eurosystem credit operations, asset-backed securities shall comply with the general eligibility criteria relating to all types of marketable assets laid down in Section 1, with the exception of the requirements laid down in Article 62 relating to the principal amount, and in addition, the specific eligibility criteria laid down in this subsection.

Article 73

Homogeneity and composition of the cash-flow generating assets

▼M7

1.  In order for ABSs to be eligible, all cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs shall be homogenous, i.e. it shall be possible to report them according to one of the types of loan-level templates referred to in Annex VIII, which shall relate to one of the following:

(a) residential mortgages;

(b) loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);

(c) auto loans;

(d) consumer finance loans;

(e) leasing receivables;

(f) credit card receivables.

▼B

2.  The Eurosystem may consider an ABS not to be homogenous upon assessment of the data submitted by a counterparty.

3.  ABSs shall not contain any cash-flow generating assets originated directly by the SPV issuing the ABSs.

4.  The cash-flow generating assets shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of tranches of other ABSs. This criterion shall not exclude ABSs where the issuance structure includes two SPVs and the ‘true sale’ criterion is met in respect of those SPVs so that the debt instruments issued by the second SPV are directly or indirectly backed by the original pool of assets and all cash flows from the cash-flow generating assets are transferred from the first to the second SPV.

5.  The cash-flow generating assets shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of credit-linked notes, swaps or other derivatives instruments, synthetic securities or similar claims. This restriction shall not encompass swaps used in ABS transactions strictly for hedging purposes.

▼M6 —————

▼M4 —————

▼B

Article 74

Geographical restrictions concerning asset-backed securities and cash-flow generating assets

1.  The issuer of ABSs shall be an SPV established in the EEA.

2.  The cash-flow generating assets shall be originated by an originator incorporated in the EEA and sold to the SPV by the originator or by an intermediary incorporated in the EEA.

▼M7

3.  For the purpose of paragraph 2, a mortgage trustee or receivables trustee shall be considered to be an intermediary.

4.  The obligors and the creditors of the cash-flow generating assets shall be incorporated, or, if they are natural persons, shall be resident in the EEA. Obligors who are natural persons must have been resident in the EEA at the time the cash-flow generating assets were originated. Any related security shall be located in the EEA and the law governing the cash-flow generating assets shall be the law of an EEA country.

▼B

Article 75

Acquisition of cash-flow generating assets by the SPV

1.  The acquisition of the cash-flow generating assets by the SPV shall be governed by the law of a Member State.

2.  The cash-flow generating assets shall have been acquired by the SPV from the originator or from an intermediary as laid down in Article 74(2) in a manner which the Eurosystem considers to be a ‘true sale’ that is enforceable against any third party, and which is beyond the reach of the originator and its creditors or the intermediary and its creditors, including in the event of the originator's or the intermediary's insolvency.

Article 76

Assessment of clawback rules for asset-backed securities

1.  ABSs shall only be considered eligible if the Eurosystem has ascertained that its rights would be protected in an appropriate manner against clawback rules considered relevant by the Eurosystem under the law of the relevant EEA country. For this purpose, before the ABSs may be considered eligible, the Eurosystem may require:

(a) an independent legal assessment in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem that sets out the applicable clawback rules in the relevant country; and/or

(b) other documents, such as a solvency certificate from the transferor for the suspect period, which is a certain period of time during which the sale of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs may be invalidated by a liquidator.

2.  Clawback rules, which the Eurosystem considers to be severe and therefore not acceptable, shall include:

(a) rules under which the sale of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs can be invalidated by a liquidator solely on the basis that the sale was concluded within the suspect period, as referred to in paragraph 1(b), before the declaration of insolvency of the seller; or

(b) rules where such invalidation can only be prevented by the transferee if they can prove that they were not aware of the insolvency of the seller at the time of the sale.

For the purposes of this criterion, the seller may be the originator or intermediary, as applicable.

Article 77

Non-subordination of tranches for asset-backed securities

1.  Only tranches or sub-tranches of ABSs that are not subordinated to other tranches of the same issue over the lifetime of the ABS shall be considered eligible.

2.  A tranche or sub-tranche shall be considered to be non-subordinated to other tranches or sub-tranches of the same issue if, in accordance with the post-enforcement priority of payments, and if applicable, the post-acceleration priority of payments as set out in the prospectus, no other tranche or sub-tranche shall be given priority over that tranche or sub-tranche in respect of receiving payment, i.e. principal and interest, and thereby such tranche or sub-tranche shall be last in incurring losses among the different tranches or sub-tranches.

▼M4

Article 77a

Restrictions on investments for asset-backed securities

Any investments of monies standing to the credit of the issuer's or of any intermediary SPV's bank accounts under the transaction documentation shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of tranches of other ABSs, credit-linked notes, swaps or other derivative instruments, synthetic securities or similar claims.

▼B

Article 78

Availability of loan level data for asset-backed securities

▼M7

1.  Comprehensive and standardised loan-level data on the pool of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs shall be made available in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex VIII, which include the information on the required data quality score and the requirements for loan-level data repositories. In its eligibility assessment, the Eurosystem takes account of: (a) any failure to deliver data, and (b) how frequently individual loan-level data fields are found not to contain meaningful data.

2.  Notwithstanding the required scoring values set out in Annex VIII in respect of loan-level data, the Eurosystem may accept as collateral asset-backed securities with a score lower than the required scoring value (A1), on a case-by-case basis and subject to the provision of adequate explanations for the failure to achieve the required score. For each adequate explanation, the Eurosystem shall specify a maximum tolerance level and a tolerance horizon, as further specified on the ECB's website. The tolerance horizon shall indicate the time period within which the data quality for the ABSs must improve.

▼B

Article 79

Data requests for asset-backed securities

The Eurosystem shall reserve the right to request from any third party it considers relevant, including but not restricted to, the issuer, the originator and/or the arranger, any clarification and/or legal confirmation that it considers necessary to assess the eligibility of ABSs and with regard to the provision of loan-level data. If a third party fails to comply with a particular request, the Eurosystem may decide not to accept the ABSs as collateral or may decide to suspend the eligibility of such collateral.



Subsection 2

Specific eligibility criteria for covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities

Article 80

Eligibility criteria for covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities

1.  In the case of covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities, the cover pool of the covered bond shall only contain ABSs that comply with all of the following.

(a) The cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs meet the criteria laid down in Article 129(1)(d) to (f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in respect of ABSs backing covered bonds.

(b) The cash-flow generating assets were originated by an entity closely linked to the issuer of the covered bonds, as described in Article 138.

(c) They are used as a technical tool to transfer mortgages or guaranteed real estate loans from the originating entity into the cover pool of the respective covered bond.

2.  Subject to paragraph 4, the NCBs shall use the following measures to verify that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1.

(a) On a quarterly basis, the NCBs shall request a self-certification and undertaking of the issuer confirming that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1. The NCB's request shall specify that the self-certification must be signed by the issuer's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on their behalf.

(b) On an annual basis, NCBs shall request an ex post confirmation by external auditors or cover pool monitors from the issuer, confirming that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1 for the monitoring period.

3.  If the issuer fails to comply with a particular request or if the Eurosystem deems the content of a confirmation incorrect or insufficient to the extent that it is not possible to verify that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs comply with criteria in paragraph 1, the Eurosystem shall decide not to accept the covered bonds as eligible collateral or to suspend their eligibility.

4.  Where the applicable legislation or prospectus exclude the inclusion of ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1 as cover pool assets, no verification pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be required.

5.  For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the close links shall be determined at the time that the senior units of the asset-backed securities are transferred into the cover pool of the covered bond.



Subsection 3

Specific eligibility criteria for debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem

Article 81

Eligibility criteria for debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem

1.  Debt certificates issued by the ECB and debt certificates issued by the NCBs prior to the date of adoption of the euro in their respective Member State whose currency is the euro shall be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations.

2.  Debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem shall not be subject to the criteria laid down in this Chapter.

Subsection 4

Specific eligibility criteria for certain unsecured debt instruments

▼M6

Article 81a

Eligibility criteria for certain unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions or investment firms, or by their closely linked entities

1.  By derogation from Article 64 and provided that they fulfil all other eligibility criteria, the following subordinated unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions or investment firms, or by their closely linked entities as referred to in Article 141(3), shall be eligible until maturity, provided that they are issued before 31 December 2018 and their subordination results neither from contractual subordination as defined in paragraph 2 nor from structural subordination pursuant to paragraph 3:

▼M7

— debt instruments issued by agencies,

▼M6

— debt instruments guaranteed by a Union public sector entity which has the right to levy taxes by way of a guarantee that complies with the features laid down in Article 114(1) to (4) and Article 115.

2.  For the purposes of paragraph 1, contractual subordination means subordination based on the terms and conditions of an unsecured debt instrument, irrespective of whether such subordination is statutorily recognised.

3.  Unsecured debt instruments issued by holding companies, including any intermediate holding companies, subject to national legislation implementing Directive 2014/59/EU or to similar recovery and resolution frameworks, shall be ineligible.

4.  For unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions or investment firms, or by their closely linked entities as referred to in Article 141(3), other than unsecured debt instruments issued by multilateral development banks or international organisations as referred to in Article 70(4), the issuer shall be established in the Union.

CHAPTER 2

Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for marketable assets

Article 82

Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for marketable assets

1.  Further to the general rules set out in Article 59 and to the specific rules set out in Article 84, marketable assets shall comply with the following credit quality requirements in order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations:

(a) With the exception of ABSs, all marketable assets shall have a credit assessment provided by at least one accepted ECAI system, expressed in the form of a public credit rating, in compliance with, as a minimum, credit quality step 3 in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.

(b) ABSs shall have credit assessments that are provided by at least two different accepted ECAI systems expressed in the form of two public credit ratings, one provided by each of these ECAI systems, in compliance with, as a minimum, credit quality step 2 in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.

2.  The Eurosystem may request any clarification that it considers necessary as regards the public credit rating referred to in paragraph 1.

Article 83

Types of ECAI credit assessments used for credit quality assessments of marketable assets

The following types of ECAI credit assessments from accepted ECAIs shall be used in determining compliance with the credit quality requirements applicable to marketable assets.

▼M4

(a)

An ECAI issue rating : this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to either an issue or, in the absence of an issue rating from the same ECAI, the programme or issuance series under which an asset is issued. An ECAI assessment for a programme or issuance series shall only be relevant if it applies to the particular asset in question and is explicitly and unambiguously matched with the asset's ISIN code by the ECAI, and a different issue rating from the same ECAI does not exist. For ECAI issue ratings, the Eurosystem shall make no distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset.

▼B

(b)

An ECAI issuer rating :

this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to an issuer. For ECAI issuer ratings, the Eurosystem shall make a distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset as regards the acceptable ECAI credit assessment. The distinction shall be made between:

(i) short-term assets, i.e. those assets with an original maturity of up to and including 390 days; and

(ii) long-term assets, i.e. those assets with an original maturity of more than 390 days. For short-term assets, ECAI short-term and long-term issuer ratings shall be acceptable. For long-term assets, only ECAI long-term issuer ratings shall be acceptable.

(c)

An ECAI guarantor rating : this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to a guarantor, if the guarantee meets the requirements of Title IV. For ECAI guarantor ratings, the Eurosystem shall make no distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset. Only ECAI long-term guarantor ratings shall be acceptable.

Article 84

Priority of ECAI credit assessments in respect of marketable assets

For marketable assets, ECAI credit assessments which determine the compliance of the asset with the credit quality requirements shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem in accordance with the following rules:

(a) For marketable assets other than marketable assets issued by central governments, regional governments, local governments, agencies, multilateral development banks or international organisations and ABSs, the following rules shall apply.

(i) The Eurosystem shall consider ECAI issue ratings in priority to ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor ratings. Without prejudice to the application of this priority rule, in accordance with Article 82(1)(a), at least one ECAI credit assessment must comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements.

(ii) If multiple ECAI issue ratings are available for the same issue, then the first-best of those ECAI issue ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem. If the first-best ECAI issue rating does not comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality threshold for marketable assets, the asset shall not be eligible, even if a guarantee that is acceptable under Title IV exists.

▼M6

(iii) In the absence of any ECAI issue rating or, in the case of covered bonds, in the absence of an issue rating fulfilling the requirements of Annex IXb, an ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor rating may be considered by the Eurosystem. If multiple ECAI issuer and/or ECAI guarantor ratings are available for the same issue, then the first-best of those ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem.

▼B

(b) For marketable assets issued by central governments, regional governments, local governments, agencies, multilateral development banks or international organisations, the following rules shall apply.

(i) In accordance with Article 82(1)(a), at least one ECAI credit assessment must comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements. The Eurosystem shall only consider ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor ratings.

(ii) If multiple ECAI issuer and ECAI guarantor ratings are available, the first-best of those ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem.

(iii) Covered bonds issued by agencies shall not be assessed in accordance with the rules in this point and shall instead be assessed in accordance with point (a).

(c) For ABSs, the following rules shall apply.

(i) In accordance with Article 82(1)(b), at least two ECAI credit assessments shall comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements. The Eurosystem shall only consider ECAI issue ratings.

(ii) If more than two ECAI issue ratings are available, the first- and second-best of such ECAI issue ratings shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem.

Article 85

Multi-issuer securities

For marketable assets with more than one issuer (multi-issuer securities), the applicable ECAI issuer rating shall be determined on the basis of each issuer's potential liability as follows:

(a) If each issuer is jointly and severally liable for the obligations of all other issuers under the issue or, if applicable, for the programme, or issuance series, the ECAI issuer rating to be considered shall be the highest rating among the first-best ECAI issuer ratings of all the relevant issuers; or

(b) If any issuer is not jointly and severally liable for the obligations of all other issuers under the issue or, if applicable, for the programme, or issuance series, the ECAI issuer rating to be considered shall be the lowest rating among the first-best ECAI issuer ratings of all the relevant issuers.

Article 86

Non-euro ratings

For the purpose of ECAI issuer ratings, a foreign currency rating shall be acceptable. If the asset is denominated in the domestic currency of the issuer, the local currency rating shall also be acceptable.

Article 87

Credit quality assessment criteria for marketable assets in the absence of a credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI

1.  In the absence of an appropriate credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI for the issue, issuer or guarantor, as would be applicable pursuant to Article 84(a) or (b), an implicit credit assessment of marketable assets (with the exception of ABSs) shall be derived by the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3. This implicit credit assessment is required to comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements.

▼M6

2.  If the debt instruments are issued or guaranteed by a regional government or a local authority or a ‘public sector entity’ as defined in point 8 of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (hereinafter a ‘CRR public sector entity’) established in a Member State whose currency is the euro, the credit assessment shall be performed by the Eurosystem in accordance with the following rules.

(a) If the issuers or guarantors are regional governments, local authorities or CRR public sector entities, which are treated for capital requirements purposes pursuant to Articles 115(2) or 116(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 equally to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are established, the debt instruments issued or guaranteed by these entities shall be allocated the credit quality step corresponding to the best credit rating provided by an accepted ECAI to the central government in whose jurisdiction these entities are established.

(b) If the issuers or guarantors are regional governments, local authorities and CRR public sector entities which are not referred to in point (a) the debt instruments issued or guaranteed by these entities shall be allocated the credit step corresponding to one credit quality step below the best credit rating provided by an accepted ECAI to the central government in which jurisdiction these entities are established.

(c) If the issuers or guarantors are ‘public sector entities’ as defined in point (75) of Article 2 and that are not referred to in points (a) and (b), no implicit credit assessment is derived and the debt instruments issued or guaranteed by these entities shall be treated equally to debt instruments issued or guaranteed by private sector entities.

▼B

3.  If the debt instruments are issued or guaranteed by non-financial corporations established in a Member State whose currency is the euro, the credit quality assessment shall be performed by the Eurosystem based on the credit quality assessment rules applicable to the credit quality assessment of credit claims in Chapter 2 of Title III. Assets in relation to which the credit quality is assessed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph shall not be included in the public list of eligible marketable assets.

Article 88

Additional credit quality requirements for asset-backed securities

1.  For ABSs, the credit quality assessment shall be based on a public issue rating that is explained in a publicly available credit rating report, i.e. a new issue report. The publicly available credit rating report shall include, inter alia, a comprehensive analysis of structural and legal aspects, a detailed collateral pool assessment, an analysis of the transaction participants, as well as an analysis of any other relevant details of a transaction.

2.  Further to the requirement in paragraph 1, regular surveillance reports published by the accepted ECAIs are required for asset-backed securities. The publication of these reports shall take place no later than four weeks after the coupon payment date of the ABSs. The reference date of these reports shall be the most recent coupon payment date except for ABSs paying the coupon on a monthly basis, in which case the surveillance report shall be published at least quarterly. The surveillance reports shall contain, as a minimum, the key transaction data, e.g. composition of the collateral pool, transaction participants, capital structure, as well as performance data.



TITLE III

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND CREDIT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS



CHAPTER 1

Eligibility criteria for non-marketable assets



Section 1

Eligibility criteria for credit claims

Article 89

Eligible type of asset

1.  The eligible type of asset shall be a credit claim that is a debt obligation of a debtor vis-à-vis a counterparty.

2.  Types of credit claims that have a ‘reducing balance’, i.e. where the principal and interest are paid off according to a pre-agreed schedule, as well as drawn credit lines, shall be eligible types of credit claim.

3.  Current account overdrafts, letters of credit and undrawn credit lines, e.g. undrawn facilities of revolving credit claims, which authorise the use of credit but are not credit claims per se, shall not be eligible types of credit claim.

4.  A syndicated loan share shall be an eligible type of credit claim. For the purposes of this Section, a syndicated loan share means a credit claim resulting from the participation of a lender in a loan provided by a group of lenders in a lending syndicate.

5.  A credit claim granted in a context other than a mere lending relationship may constitute an eligible type of asset. A claim inherent to certain leasing or factoring structures may qualify as an eligible type of asset, if it constitutes a credit claim. Claims purchased under a factoring only qualify as an eligible type of asset to the extent they actually constitute credit claims as opposed to other claims, such as purchase price claims.

▼M7

Article 90

Principal amount and coupons of credit claims

In order to be eligible, credit claims shall comply with the following requirements:

(a) they have, until final redemption, a fixed, unconditional principal amount; and

(b) an interest rate that shall, until final redemption, be one of the following:

(i) a ‘zero coupon’;

(ii) fixed;

(iii) floating, i.e. linked to a reference interest rate and with the following structure: coupon rate = reference rate ± x, with f ≤ coupon rate ≤ c, where:

— the reference rate is only one of the following at a single point in time:

—

 
— a euro money market rate, e.g. Euribor, LIBOR or similar indices;

— a constant maturity swap rate, e.g. CMS, EIISDA, EUSA;

— the yield of one or an index of several euro area government bonds;

— f (floor), c (ceiling), if they are present, and x (margin) are numbers that are either pre-defined at origination or may change over the life of the credit claim; f and/or c may also be introduced after origination of the credit claim; and

(c) their most recent cash flow was not negative. If a negative cash flow occurs, the credit claim is ineligible as at that moment. It may become eligible again after a cash flow that is not negative, provided it meets all other relevant requirements.

▼B

Article 91

Non-subordination

Credit claims may not afford rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to: (a) the rights of holders of other unsecured debt obligations of the debtor including other shares or sub-shares in the same syndicated loan; and (b) the rights of holders of debt instruments of the same issuer.

Article 92

Credit quality requirements for credit claims

The credit quality of credit claims is assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor or guarantor. The relevant debtor or guarantor shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements as specified in the ECAF rules for credit claims laid down in Chapter 2 of Title III of Part Four.

▼M7

Article 93

Minimum size of credit claims

For domestic use, credit claims shall, at the time of their submission as collateral by the counterparty, meet a minimum size threshold of EUR 25 000 , or any higher amount that may be laid down by the home NCB. For cross-border use, a minimum size threshold of EUR 500 000 shall apply.

▼B

Article 94

Currency of denomination of credit claims

Credit claims shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of the Member States whose currency is the euro.

Article 95

Type of debtor or guarantor

▼M7

1.  The debtors and guarantors of eligible credit claims shall be non-financial corporations, public sector entities (excluding public financial corporations), multilateral development banks or international organisations.

▼B

2.  If a credit claim has more than one debtor, each debtor shall be individually and severally liable for the full repayment of the entire credit claim.

Article 96

Location of the debtor or guarantor

1.  The debtor in respect of a credit claim shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.

2.  The guarantor in respect of a credit claim shall also be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets because there is an adequate credit assessment of the debtor.

▼M2

3.  For debtors or guarantors that are multilateral development banks or international organisations, the rules in paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively, shall not apply and they shall be eligible irrespective of their place of establishment.

▼B

Article 97

Governing laws

The credit claim agreement and the agreement between the counterparty and the home NCB mobilising the credit claim as collateral shall both be governed by the law of a Member State whose currency is the euro. Furthermore, there shall be no more than two governing laws in total that apply to the:

(a) counterparty;

(b) creditor;

(c) debtor;

(d) guarantor (if relevant);

(e) credit claim agreement;

(f) the agreement between the counterparty and the home NCB mobilising the credit claim as collateral.

Article 98

Handling procedures

Credit claims shall be handled in accordance with the Eurosystem procedures laid down in the relevant national documentation of the NCBs.

▼M2

Article 99

Additional legal requirements for credit claims

1.  In order to ensure that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claim can be swiftly realised in the event of a counterparty default, additional legal requirements shall be met. These legal requirements relate to:

(a) verification of the existence of credit claims;

(b) validity of the agreement for the mobilisation of credit claims;

(c) full effect of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties;

(d) an absence of restrictions concerning the mobilisation and realisation of credit claims;

(e) an absence of restrictions concerning banking secrecy and confidentiality.

2.  The content of these legal requirements is set out in Articles 100 to 105. Further details of the specific features of the national jurisdictions are provided in the relevant national documentation of the NCBs.

▼M7

Article 100

Verifications of the procedures used to submit credit claims

NCBs, or supervisors or external auditors, shall conduct a one-off verification of the appropriateness of the procedures used by the counterparty to submit the information on credit claims to the Eurosystem. In the event of significant changes to such procedures, a new one-off verification of those procedures may be conducted.

▼B

Article 101

Verification of existence of credit claims

1.  The NCBs shall, as a minimum, take all of the following steps to verify the existence of credit claims mobilised as collateral:

(a) They shall obtain a written confirmation from counterparties, at least each quarter, by which counterparties shall confirm:

(i) the existence of the credit claims (this confirmation could be replaced with cross-checks of information held in central credit registers, where these exist);

(ii) the compliance of credit claims with the eligibility criteria applied by the Eurosystem;

(iii) that such credit claim is not used simultaneously as collateral to the benefit of any third party and that the counterparty shall not mobilise such credit claim as collateral to any third party;

(iv) that the counterparty will undertake to communicate to the relevant NCB no later than within the course of the next business day, any event that materially affects the contractual relationship between the counterparty and the NCB, in particular early, partial or total repayments, downgrades and material changes in the conditions of the credit claim.

(b) They, or relevant central credit registers, banking supervision competent authorities or external auditors, shall perform random checks in respect of the quality and accuracy of the written confirmation of counterparties, by means of delivery of physical documentation or through on-site visits. The information checked in relation to each credit claim shall cover as a minimum the characteristics that determine the existence and the eligibility of credit claims. For counterparties with ECAF-approved internal ratings-based (IRB) systems, additional checks on the credit quality assessment of credit claims shall be carried out involving checks of PDs with respect to debtors of credit claims that are used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.

2.  For the checks that are undertaken in accordance with Article 100 or paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of this Article by NCBs, supervisors, external auditors or central credit registers, those undertaking the checks shall be authorised to carry out these investigations, if necessary contractually or in accordance with the applicable national requirements.

Article 102

Validity of the agreement for the mobilisation of credit claims

The agreement for the mobilisation of the credit claim as collateral shall be valid between the counterparty and the relevant NCB under the applicable national law. All the necessary legal formalities to ensure the validity of the agreement and to ensure the mobilisation of a credit claims as collateral shall be fulfilled by the counterparty and/or the transferee, as appropriate.

Article 103

Full effect of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties

1.  The agreement for the mobilisation of the credit claim as collateral shall be valid vis-à-vis third parties under the applicable national law. All legal formalities necessary to ensure valid mobilisation shall be fulfilled by the counterparty and/or the transferee, as appropriate.

2.  As regards notification of the debtor, the following shall apply, depending on the applicable national law.

(a) If debtor notification or public registration of the mobilisation of a credit claim as collateral is necessary to ensure full effectiveness of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties, and in particular to ensure the priority of the home NCB's security interest vis-à-vis other creditors, these notification or registration requirements shall be completed in advance or at the time of the credit claim's actual mobilisation as collateral.

(b) If ex ante notification of the debtor or public registration of the mobilisation of a credit claim as collateral is not required in accordance with point (a), as specified in the applicable national documentation, ex post notification of the debtor is required. Ex post notification means that the debtor shall be notified by the counterparty or the home NCB, as specified by the national documentation, about the credit claim being mobilised as collateral by the counterparty to the benefit of the NCB immediately following an event of default or similar credit event as further specified in the applicable national documentation.

(c) The NCBs may decide to require ex ante notification or public registration in advance or at the time of mobilisation, even if these formalities are not necessary for the purposes set out in point (a).

(d) For credit claims that are bearer instruments, the home NCB may require that such bearer instruments are physically transferred to it or to a third party in advance, or at the time of actual mobilisation as collateral. The notification requirements set out in points (a) and (b) shall not apply to credit claims that are bearer instruments.

3.  The above are minimum requirements. NCBs may decide to require ex ante notification or registration in addition to the situations above, including in the case of bearer instruments.

Article 104

Absence of restrictions concerning mobilisation and realisation of credit claims

1.  Credit claims shall be fully transferable and capable of being mobilised without restriction for the benefit of the Eurosystem. The credit claim agreement or other contractual arrangements between the counterparty and the debtor shall not contain any restrictive provisions on mobilisation as collateral, unless national legislation provides that such contractual restrictions are without prejudice to the Eurosystem with respect to the mobilisation of collateral.

2.  The credit claim agreement or other contractual arrangements between the counterparty and the debtor shall not contain any restrictive provisions regarding the realisation of the credit claim used as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, including any form, time or other requirement with regard to realisation.

3.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the provisions restricting the assignment of syndicated loan shares to banks, financial institutions and entities which are regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of creating, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets shall not be considered as a restriction on the realisation of the credit claim.

▼M4

3a.  From 1 January 2018, NCBs shall employ a mechanism to ensure that set-off risk has been excluded or significantly mitigated when they accept as collateral credit claims originated after that date. Credit claims originated before 1 January 2018 which have not been subject to that mechanism may be mobilised as collateral until 31 December 2019 provided that all other eligibility criteria are fulfilled.

▼B

4.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a facility agent for the collection and distribution of payments and administration of the loan shall not be considered as a restriction on the mobilisation and realisation of a syndicated loan share, provided that: (a) the facility agent is a credit institution located in the Union; and (b) the service relationship between the relevant syndicate member and the facility agent can be transferred alongside or as part of the syndicated loan share.

Article 105

Absence of restrictions concerning banking secrecy and confidentiality

The counterparty and the debtor shall have agreed contractually that the debtor unconditionally consents to disclosure by the counterparty to the Eurosystem of details in respect of the credit claim and on the debtor that are required by the home NCB for the purpose of ensuring that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claims can be swiftly realised in the event of a counterparty default. This requirement shall not be necessary if unrestricted provision of such information is ensured under the applicable national law, as specified in the applicable national documentation of the home NCB.



Section 2

Eligibility criteria for fixed-term deposits

Article 106

Eligibility criteria for fixed-term deposits

Eligibility criteria for RMBDs

Article 107

Eligibility criteria for RMBDs

1.  An RMBD shall be a promissory note or a bill of exchange that is secured by a pool of residential mortgages but falls short of full securitisation. Substitution of assets in the underlying pool shall be possible and a mechanism shall be in place to ensure that the home NCB enjoys priority over creditors other than those exempted for public policy reasons.

2.  RMBDs shall have a fixed, unconditional principal amount and an interest rate that cannot result in a negative cash flow.

3.  RMBDs shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified in the ECAF rules for RMBDs as laid down in Chapter 2 of Title III of this Part Four.

4.  RMBDs shall be issued by credit institutions that are counterparties which are established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.

(a) a specific ECB DECC loan-level data reporting template; or

(b) an ABS loan-level data reporting template in accordance with Article 73;

is available.

▼M2

3.  The underlying credit claims shall be those granted to debtors established in a Member State whose currency is the euro. The originator shall be a Eurosystem counterparty established in a Member State whose currency is the euro and the issuer shall have acquired the credit claim from the originator.

▼C1

4.  The DECC issuer shall be a special purpose entity established in a Member State whose currency is the euro. Parties to the transaction, other than the issuer, the debtors of the underlying credit claims, and the originator, shall be established in the EEA.

▼M2

5.  The DECCs shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of the Member States whose currency is the euro.

6.  After having carried out a positive assessment, the Eurosystem shall approve the DECC structure as being eligible as Eurosystem collateral.

7.  The governing law applicable to the DECC, the originator, the debtors and, where relevant, the guarantors of the underlying credit claims, the underlying credit claim agreements and any agreements ensuring the direct or indirect transfer of the underlying credit claims from the originator to the issuer shall be the law of the jurisdiction where the issuer is established.

8.  DECCs shall comply with the requirements on the place of issue and settlement procedures as laid down in Articles 66 and 67.

Article 107b

Non-subordination with respect to DECCs

Article 107e

Transparency requirements for DECCs

1.  DECCs shall fulfil transparency requirements at the level of the DECCs' structure and at the level of the underlying individual credit claims.

2.  At the level of the DECCs' structure, detailed information on the DECCs' key transaction data, such as identification of the parties to the transaction, a summary of the DECCs' key structural features, a summary description of collateral and the DECCs' terms and conditions shall be made publicly available. The Eurosystem may, in the course of its assessment, require any transaction documentation and legal opinions deemed necessary from any third party it considers relevant, including, but not restricted to, the issuer and/or the originator.

▼M7

3.  At the level of the underlying individual credit claims, comprehensive and standardised loan-level data on the pool of underlying credit claims shall be made available in accordance with the procedures and subject to the same checks applicable to cash-flow generating assets backing ABSs as set out in Annex VIII, except with respect to the reporting frequency, the applicable loan-level data reporting template and the submission by the relevant parties of loan-level data to a loan-level data repository. In order for DECCs to be eligible, all underlying credit claims shall be homogenous, i.e. it must be possible to report them using a single ECB DECC loan-level data reporting template. The Eurosystem may determine that a DECC is not homogenous after evaluating the relevant data.

▼M2

4.  Loan-level data shall be reported on at least a monthly basis, no later than one month following the cut-off date. The cut-off date for which loan-level data shall be reported is the last calendar day of the month.

The ESMA reporting activation date shall be published by the ECB on its website.

▼M2

6.  In its eligibility assessment, the Eurosystem shall take into account: (a) any failure to deliver mandatory data; and (b) how often individual loan-level data fields do not contain meaningful data.

Article 107f

Types of eligible underlying credit claims

1.  Each underlying credit claim shall comply with the eligibility criteria for credit claims provided for in Section 1, Chapter 1 of Title III of Part Four, subject to the modifications set out in this Article.

2.  To ensure that a valid security is created over the underlying credit claims, enabling the issuer and the holders of the DECCs to swiftly realise those claims in the event of the originator's default, the following additional legal requirements as specified in paragraphs 3 to 9 shall be met:

(a) verification of the existence of the underlying credit claims;

(b) validity of the agreement for the mobilisation of underlying credit claims;

3.  The NCB of the country where the originator is established, or supervisors or external auditors, shall conduct a one-off verification of the appropriateness of the procedures used by the originator to submit the information on the underlying credit claims to the Eurosystem.

4.  The NCB of the country where the originator is established shall, as a minimum, take all of the following steps to verify the existence of the underlying credit claims:

(a) It shall obtain written confirmation from the originator, at least on a quarterly basis, by which the originators shall confirm:

(i) the existence of the underlying credit claims: this confirmation could be replaced with cross-checks of information held in central credit registers, where these exist;

(ii) compliance of the underlying credit claims with the eligibility criteria applied by the Eurosystem;

(iii) that the underlying credit claims are not used simultaneously as collateral to the benefit of any third party and that the originator will not mobilise such underlying credit claims as collateral to the Eurosystem or any third party;

(iv) that the originator will undertake to communicate to the relevant NCB no later than within the course of the next business day, any event that materially affects the collateral value of the underlying credit claims, in particular early, partial or total repayments, downgrades and material changes in the conditions of the underlying credit claims.

(b) The NCB of the country where the originator is located or the relevant central credit registers, banking supervision competent authorities or external auditors, shall perform random checks in respect of the quality and accuracy of the written confirmation of originators, by means of delivery of physical documentation or through on-site visits. The information checked in relation to each underlying credit claim shall cover as a minimum the characteristics that determine the existence and the eligibility of underlying credit claims. For originators with ECAF-approved internal ratings-based (IRB) systems, additional checks on the credit quality assessment of underlying credit claims shall be carried out involving checks of PDs with respect to debtors of credit claims backing DECCs that are used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.

(c) For the checks that are undertaken in accordance with Article 107f(3), (4)(a) or (4)(b) by NCB of the country where the originator is located, supervisors, external auditors or central credit registers, those undertaking the checks shall be authorised to carry out these investigations, if necessary contractually or in accordance with the applicable national requirements.

5.  The agreement for the transfer of the underlying credit claims to the issuer or for their mobilisation by way of transfer, assignment or pledge shall be valid between the issuer and the originator and/or the transferee/assignee/pledgee, as appropriate, under the applicable national law. All the necessary legal formalities to ensure the validity of the agreement and to ensure the valid indirect or direct transfer of the underlying credit claims as collateral shall be fulfilled by the originator and/or the transferee, as appropriate. As regards notification of the debtor, the following shall apply, depending on the applicable national law.

(a) At times it may be necessary to have debtor notification or public registration of: (i) the transfer (direct or indirect) of the underlying credit claims to the issuer; or (ii) when counterparties mobilise DECCs as collateral to the home NCB to ensure full effectiveness of such a transfer or mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties; and in particular (iii) to ensure the priority of the issuer's security interest (with respect to the underlying credit claims) and/or the home NCB's security interest (with respect to the DECCs as collateral) vis-à-vis other creditors. In such cases, these notification or registration requirements shall be completed: (i) in advance or at the time of the underlying credit claims' actual transfer (direct or indirect) to the issuer; or (ii) at the time that counterparties mobilise the DECCs as collateral to the home NCB.

(b) If exante notification of the debtor or public registration is not required in accordance with point (a), as specified in the applicable national documentation, ex post notification of the debtor is required. Ex post notification means that the debtor shall be notified, as specified by national documentation, about the underlying credit claims being transferred or mobilised immediately following an event of default or similar credit event as further specified in the applicable national documentation.

(c) Points (a) and (b) are minimum requirements. The Eurosystem may decide to require ex ante notification or registration in addition to the situations above, including in the case of bearer instruments.

6.  The underlying credit claims shall be fully transferable and capable of being transferred to the issuer without restriction. The underlying credit claims agreements or other contractual arrangements between the originator and the debtor shall not contain any restrictive provisions on transfer of collateral. The underlying credit claims agreements or other contractual arrangements between the originator and the debtor shall not contain any restrictive provisions regarding the realisation of the underlying credit claims, including any restrictions regarding form, time or other requirement with regard to realisation, so the Eurosystem shall be able to realise the DECCs' collateral.

7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 6, the provisions restricting the assignment of syndicated loan shares to banks, financial institutions and entities which are regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of creating, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets shall not be considered as a restriction on the realisation of the underlying credit claims.

8.  Notwithstanding the paragraphs 6 and 7, a facility agent for the collection and distribution of payments and administration of the loan shall not be considered as a restriction on the transfer and realisation of a syndicated loan share, provided that:

(a) the facility agent is a credit institution located in a Member State; and

(b) the service relationship between the relevant syndicate member and the facility agent can be transferred alongside or as part of the syndicated loan share.

9.  The originator and the debtor shall have agreed contractually that the debtor unconditionally consents to disclosure by the originator, issuer and any counterparty mobilising the DECC to the Eurosystem of details in respect of that underlying credit claim and on the debtor that are required by the relevant NCB for the purpose of ensuring that a valid security is created over the underlying credit claims and that the underlying credit claims can be swiftly realised in the event the originator/issuer defaults.

CHAPTER 2

Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets

Article 108

Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets

In order for non-marketable assets to be eligible, the following Eurosystem credit quality requirements shall apply.

(a) For credit claims, the credit quality of credit claims shall be assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor or guarantor, which shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 3, as specified in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.

(b) For RMBDs, a credit quality assessment shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 2, as specified in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.



Section 1

Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for credit claims

Article 109

General rules for the credit quality assessment of credit claims

1.  The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims on the basis of the credit quality of the debtors or guarantors provided by the credit assessment system or source selected by the counterparty in accordance with Article 110.

2.  Counterparties shall within the course of the next business day inform the relevant NCB of any credit event, including a delay in payments by the debtors of the credit claims mobilised as collateral, that is known to the counterparty and, if requested by the relevant NCB, withdraw or replace the assets.

3.  Counterparties shall be responsible for ensuring that they use the most recent credit quality assessment available from their selected credit assessment system or source for the debtors or guarantors of credit claims mobilised as collateral.

Article 110

Selection of the credit assessment system or source

1.  Counterparties mobilising credit claims as collateral shall select one credit assessment system from one of the four credit assessment sources accepted by the Eurosystem in accordance with the general acceptance criteria in Title V of Part Four. Where the ECAI source is selected by counterparties, any ECAI system may be used.

2.  Further to paragraph 1, NCBs may allow counterparties to use more than one credit assessment system or source upon submission of a reasoned request to the home NCB supported by an adequate business case based on the lack of sufficient coverage of the ‘main’ credit assessment source or system.

3.  In cases where counterparties are allowed to use more than one credit assessment system or credit assessment source, the ‘main’ system or source is expected to be the one providing the credit quality assessment of the largest number of debtors from the credit claims mobilised as collateral. If a credit assessment for a debtor or guarantor is available from this main system or source, only this credit assessment shall determine the eligibility and valuation haircuts applicable to the debtor or guarantor.

4.  Counterparties shall use the selected credit assessment systems or sources for a minimum period of 12 months.

5.  After the period specified in paragraph 4, counterparties may submit an explicit reasoned request to the home NCB to change the selected credit assessment system or source.

6.  In certain circumstances and particularly when a counterparty phases-in its IRB system or begins using credit claims as collateral, upon submission of a reasoned request, an NCB may exceptionally grant a derogation to a counterparty with respect to the 12-month minimum period restriction specified in paragraph 4 and allow the counterparty to change its selected credit assessment system or source within that period.

7.  If the counterparty has chosen the ECAI credit assessment source, it may use an ECAI debtor or ECAI guarantor rating. If multiple ECAI debtor and/or ECAI guarantor ratings are available for the same credit claim, then the best available ECAI credit assessment of those may be used.

Article 111

Credit assessment of credit claims with public sector entities, or non-financial corporations, as debtors or guarantors

1.  The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims with public sector entities acting as debtors or guarantors in accordance with the following rules, applied in the following order.

(a) If a credit assessment from the system or source selected by the counterparty exists, the Eurosystem shall use it to establish whether the public sector entity acting as debtor or guarantor meets the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets laid down in Article 108.

(b) In the absence of a credit assessment under point (a), the Eurosystem shall use an ECAI credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI system for the public sector entity acting as debtor or guarantor.

(c) If a credit assessment is unavailable pursuant to points (a) or (b), the procedure laid down in Article 87 for marketable assets shall apply to the relevant public sector entity as debtor or guarantor.

2.  The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims with non-financial corporations as debtors or guarantors as follows: the credit assessment provided by the credit assessment system or source selected by the counterparty shall meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets laid down in Article 108.



Section 2

Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for RMBDs

Article 112

Establishment of Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for RMBDs

For the purpose of meeting the credit quality requirements laid down in Article 108, the home NCB shall assess the credit quality of RMBDs on the basis of a jurisdiction-specific credit quality assessment framework laid down in the applicable national documentation.

▼M2



Section 3

The Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for DECCs

Article 112a

The Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for DECCs

1.  DECCs shall not be required to be assessed by one of the four credit assessment sources accepted by the Eurosystem in accordance with the general acceptance criteria in Title V of Part Four.

2.  Each underlying credit claim in the cover pool of DECCs shall have a credit assessment provided by one of the four credit assessment sources accepted by the Eurosystem in accordance with the general acceptance criteria in Title V of Part Four. In addition, the credit assessment system or source used shall be the same system or source selected by the originator in accordance with Article 110. The rules on the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for the underlying credit claims laid down in Section 1 shall be applicable.

3.  The credit quality of each underlying credit claim in the cover pool of DECCs shall be assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor or guarantor, which shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 3, as specified in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.

▼B



TITLE IV

GUARANTEES FOR MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS

Article 113

Applicable requirements for guarantees

1.  The Eurosystem's credit quality requirements may be established on the basis of credit assessments provided in respect of guarantors in accordance with Articles 82 to 84 in respect of marketable assets and Article 108 in respect of credit claims.

2.  Guarantees provided by guarantors that are required to establish the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements shall comply with this Title.

3.  For the purposes of paragraph 1, the relevant guarantor shall be separately assessed on the basis of its credit assessment and shall meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements.

Article 114

Features of the guarantee

1.  In accordance with the terms of the guarantee, the guarantor shall provide an unconditional and irrevocable first-demand guarantee in respect of the obligations of the issuer or debtor in relation to the payment of the principal, interest and any other amounts due under the marketable asset or credit claim to the holders or creditor thereof, until the marketable asset or credit claim is discharged in full. In this regard, a guarantee shall not be required to be specific to the marketable asset or credit claim but may apply to the issuer or debtor only, provided that the relevant marketable asset or credit claim is covered by the guarantee.

2.  The guarantee shall be payable on first demand independently of the guaranteed marketable asset or credit claim. Guarantees given by public sector entities with the right to levy taxes shall either be payable on first demand or otherwise provide for prompt and punctual payment following any default.

3.  The guarantee shall be legally valid, binding and enforceable against the guarantor.

4.  The guarantee shall be governed by the law of a Member State.

▼M7

5.  If the guarantor is not a public sector entity with the right to levy taxes, a legal confirmation concerning the legal validity, binding effect and enforceability of the guarantee shall be submitted to the relevant NCB in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem before the marketable assets or credit claim supported by the guarantee can be considered eligible. The legal confirmation shall be prepared by persons who are independent of the counterparty, the issuer/debtor and the guarantor, and legally qualified to issue such confirmation under the applicable law, e.g. lawyers practising in a law firm, or working in a recognised academic institution or public body. The legal confirmation shall also state that the guarantee is not a personal one and is only enforceable by the holders of the marketable assets or the creditor of the credit claim. If the guarantor is established in a jurisdiction other than the one of the law governing the guarantee, the legal confirmation shall also confirm that the guarantee is valid and enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the guarantor is established. For marketable assets, the legal confirmation shall be submitted by the counterparty for review to the NCB that is reporting the relevant asset supported by a guarantee for inclusion in the list of eligible assets. For credit claims, the legal confirmation shall be submitted by the counterparty seeking to mobilise the credit claim for review to the NCB in the jurisdiction of the law governing the credit claim. The requirement of enforceability is subject to any insolvency or bankruptcy laws, general principles of equity and other similar laws and principles applicable to the guarantor and generally affecting creditors' rights against the guarantor.

▼B

Article 115

Non-subordination of the obligations of the guarantor

The obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee shall at least rank equally, pari passu, and rateably, pro rata, with all other unsecured obligations of the guarantor.

Article 116

Credit quality requirements for guarantors

The guarantor shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified under the ECAF rules for guarantors of marketable assets laid down in Articles 82 to 84 or with the rules for guarantors of credit claims laid down in Article 108.

Article 117

Type of guarantor

The guarantor shall be:

(a) for marketable assets in accordance with Article 69: a central bank of a Member State, a public sector entity, an agency, a credit institution, a financial corporation other than a credit institution, a non-financial corporation, a multilateral development bank or an international organisation; or

(b) for credit claims in accordance with Article 95: a non-financial corporation, a public sector entity, a multilateral development bank or an international organisation.

Article 118

Place of establishment of guarantor

1.  The guarantor shall be established:

(a) in the case of marketable assets in accordance with Article 70, in the EEA, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for a specific debt instrument. The possibility to use an ECAI guarantor rating to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for marketable assets is addressed in Article 84.

(b) for debt instruments guaranteed by non-financial corporations for which no credit assessment has been provided by an accepted ECAI for the issue, the issuer or the guarantor, in accordance with Article 70, the guarantor shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro;

(c) in the case of credit claims in accordance with Article 96, in a Member State whose currency is the euro, unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets. The option to use a credit assessment in respect of a guarantor to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for credit claims is addressed in Article 108.

2.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, in accordance with Articles 70 and 96, multilateral development banks and international organisations shall be eligible guarantors irrespective of their place of establishment.



TITLE V

EUROSYSTEM CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ELIGIBLE ASSETS

Article 119

Accepted credit assessment sources and systems

▼M7

1.  The credit assessment information on which the Eurosystem bases the eligibility assessment of assets eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be provided by credit assessment systems belonging to one of the three following sources:

(a) ECAIs;

(b) NCBs' in-house credit assessment systems (ICASs);

(c) counterparties' internal rating-based (IRB) systems.

2.  Under each credit assessment source listed in paragraph 1 there may be a set of credit assessment systems. Credit assessment systems shall comply with the acceptance criteria laid down in this Title. A list of the accepted credit assessment systems, i.e. the list of accepted ECAIs and ICASs, is published on the ECB's website.

▼B

3.  All accepted credit assessment systems shall be subject to the ECAF performance monitoring process as laid down in Article 126.

4.  By publishing information on the accepted credit assessment systems in conjunction with its Eurosystem credit operations, the Eurosystem shall not assume any responsibility for its evaluation of accepted credit assessment systems.

5.  In the event of an infringement of the ECAF rules and procedures, the relevant credit assessment system may be excluded from the ECAF-accepted systems.

Article 120

General acceptance criteria for external credit assessment institutions as credit assessment systems

▼M4

1.  For the purposes of the ECAF, the general acceptance criteria for ECAIs shall be the following:

(a) ECAIs shall be registered by the European Securities and Markets Authority in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.

(b) ECAIs shall fulfil operational criteria and provide relevant coverage so as to ensure the efficient implementation of the ECAF. In particular, the use of an ECAI credit assessment is subject to the availability to the Eurosystem of information on these assessments, as well as information for the comparison and the assignment, i.e. mapping of the assessments to the Eurosystem's credit quality steps and for the purposes of the performance monitoring process under Article 126.

2.  The Eurosystem reserves the right to decide whether to initiate an ECAF acceptance procedure upon request from a credit rating agency (CRA). In making its decision, the Eurosystem shall take into account, among other things, whether the CRA provides relevant coverage for the efficient implementation of the ECAF in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex IXa.

▼M4

2a.  Following the initiation of an ECAF acceptance procedure, the Eurosystem shall investigate all additional information deemed relevant to ensure the efficient implementation of the ECAF, including the ECAI's capacity to fulfil the criteria and rules of the ECAF performance monitoring process in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex IX and the specific criteria in Annex IXb (if relevant). The Eurosystem reserves the right to decide whether to accept an ECAI for the purposes of the ECAF on the basis of the information provided and its own due diligence assessment.

▼B

3.  Together with the submitted data for ECAF performance monitoring in accordance with Article 126, the ECAI shall submit a signed certification from the CEO of the ECAI, or authorised signatory with responsibility for the audit or compliance function within the ECAI, confirming the accuracy and validity of the submitted performance monitoring information.

Article 121

General acceptance criteria and operational procedures for the NCBs' in-house credit assessment systems

1.  NCBs may decide to use their own ICAS for the purpose of credit assessment. The decision of an NCB to use its own ICAS shall be subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem.

2.  A credit assessment by means of ICAS may be performed in advance, or on a counterparty's specific request upon submission of an asset to the NCB using ICAS (the ‘ICAS NCB’).

3.  With regard to paragraph 2, upon submission of an asset to the ICAS NCB in respect of which the eligibility of a debtor or guarantor shall be assessed, the ICAS NCB informs the counterparty either of its eligibility status or of the lead time necessary to establish a credit assessment. If an ICAS is limited in scope and only assesses specific types of debtors or guarantors, or if the ICAS NCB is unable to receive the information and data necessary for its credit assessment, the ICAS NCB will inform the counterparty thereof without delay. In both cases, the relevant debtor or guarantor is considered ineligible, unless the assets are compliant with credit quality requirements in accordance with an alternative credit assessment source or credit assessment system which the counterparty is allowedto use according to Article 110. In the event that mobilised assets become ineligible due to the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the debtor or the guarantor, the asset shall be removed at the earliest possible date. Since there is neither a contractual relationship between the non-financial corporations and the ICAS NCB, nor any legal obligation for these corporations to provide non-public information to the ICAS NCB, the information is provided on a voluntary basis.

4.  In countries in which RMBDs are mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, the home NCB shall implement a credit assessment framework for this type of asset in accordance with the ECAF. Such frameworks shall be subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem and to a yearly performance monitoring process, as further specified in Article 126.

Article 122

General acceptance criteria for internal ratings-based systems

1.  To obtain ECAF approval of an IRB system, a counterparty shall file a request with the home NCB.

2.  The requirement in paragraph 1 shall apply to all counterparties intending to use an IRB system regardless of their status, i.e. parent, subsidiary or branch, and regardless of whether the endorsement of the IRB system comes from the competent authority in the same country, for a parent company and possibly for subsidiaries, or from a competent authority in the home country of the parent, for branches and possibly for subsidiaries.

3.  A request filed by a counterparty in accordance with paragraph 1 shall include the following information and documents which, if necessary, shall be translated into a working language of the home NCB:

(a) a copy of the decision of the competent authority authorising the counterparty to use its IRB system for capital requirements purposes on a consolidated or non-consolidated basis, together with any specific conditions for such use;

▼M4

(b) an up-to-date assessment by the competent authority reflecting the currently available information on all issues affecting the use of the IRB for collateral purposes and all issues relating to the data used for the ECAF performance monitoring process;

▼B

(c) information on any changes to the counterparty's IRB system recommended or required by the competent authority, together with the deadline by which such changes must be implemented;

(d) information on its approach to assigning probabilities of default to debtors, as well as data on the rating grades and associated one-year probabilities of default used to determine eligible rating grades;

(e) a copy of the latest Pillar 3 (market discipline) information that the counterparty is required to publish on a regular basis in accordance with the requirements on market discipline under the Basel III Framework, Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

(f) the name and the address of the competent authority and the external auditor;

(g) information on the historical record of the counterparty's IRB system's observed default rates per rating grades covering the five calendar years preceding the relevant request. If the competent authority granted the IRB system's authorisation for capital requirements purposes during these calendar years, the information shall cover the time since the IRB system's authorisation for capital requirements purposes. The historical annual data on the observed default rates and potential additional information shall comply with the provisions for performance monitoring in Article 126 as if the IRB system had been subject to these provisions over this time period;

(h) information required for performance monitoring outlined in Article 126 as requested from already ECAF-approved IRB systems for the ongoing calendar year at the time of the filing of the request.

4.  A counterparty shall not be required to file the information under points (a) to (c) when such information is transmitted directly by the competent authority to the home NCB upon the NCB's request.

5.  The request made by the counterparty under paragraph 1 shall be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them.

Article 123

Reporting obligations of counterparties using an internal ratings-based system

1.  Counterparties shall communicate information to the home NCB on Article 122(3)(b) to (f) on an annual basis, or as and when required by the home NCB, unless such information is transmitted directly by the competent authority to the home NCB upon the NCB's request.

2.  The annual communication referred to in paragraph 1 shall be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them. The competent authority and, where applicable, the external auditor of the counterparty shall receive a copy of this letter from the Eurosystem.

3.  As part of the regular monitoring on IRB systems, the NCB shall perform on- and off-site inspections on the statistical information provided by counterparties for the purpose of the annual performance monitoring process. The objective of such controls shall be to verify that static pools are correct, accurate and complete.

4.  Counterparties shall fulfil any further operational criteria specified in the relevant contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB, including provisions in relation to:

(a) ad hoc checks on the procedures in place for communicating a credit claim's features to the home NCB;

(b) annual checks by the home NCB (or, where relevant, the competent authority or external auditor) to establish the accuracy and validity of static pools as referred to in Annex IX;

(c) the provision, no later than within the course of the next business day, of information in respect of eligibility changes and the immediate withdrawal of relevant credit claims, if necessary;

(d) notifications to the home NCB of facts or circumstances that could materially influence the continued use of the IRB system for ECAF purposes or the way in which the IRB system leads to the establishment of eligible collateral, including in particular material changes to a counterparty's IRB system which may impact on the manner in which the IRB system's rating grades or probabilities of default correspond with the Eurosystem harmonised rating scale.

▼M7 —————

▼B

Article 126

ECAF performance monitoring process

1.  On an annual basis, all accepted credit assessment systems shall be subject to the ECAF performance monitoring process, in accordance with Annex IX, for the purpose of ensuring that the mapping of the credit assessment information provided by the credit assessment system to the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale remains appropriate and that the results from credit assessments are comparable across systems and sources.

2.  The Eurosystem reserves the right to request any additional information required to conduct the performance monitoring process.

3.  The performance monitoring process may result in a correction of the manner in which the credit assessment information provided by the credit assessment system corresponds to the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.

4.  The Eurosystem may decide to suspend or exclude a credit assessment system on the basis of the outcome of the performance monitoring process.

5.  In the event of an infringement of a rule related to the ECAF performance monitoring process, the relevant credit assessment system may be excluded from the list of ECAF-accepted systems.



TITLE VI

RISK CONTROL AND VALUATION FRAMEWORK OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS

Article 127

Purpose of the risk control and valuation framework

1.  Eligible assets mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be subject to the risk control measures laid down in Article 128(1), which aim to protecting the Eurosystem against the risk of financial loss in the event of a counterparty's default.

2.  The Eurosystem may at any time apply additional risk control measures, as laid down in Article 128(2), if required to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB. Additional risk control measures may also be applied at the level of individual counterparties, if required to ensure such protection.

3.  All risk control measures applied by the Eurosystem shall ensure consistent, transparent and non-discriminatory conditions for any type of mobilised eligible asset across the Member States whose currency is the euro.

▼M3

Article 128

Risk control measures

1.  The Eurosystem shall apply the following risk control measures for eligible assets:

(a) valuation haircuts as laid down in Guideline (EU) 2016/65 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2015/35) ( 13 );

(b) variation margins (marking-to-market):

the Eurosystem requires the haircut-adjusted market value of the eligible assets used in its liquidity-providing reverse transactions to be maintained over time. If the value of the eligible assets, which are measured on a daily basis, falls below a certain level, the home NCB shall require the counterparty to supply additional assets or cash by way of a margin call. Similarly, if the value of the eligible assets exceeds a certain level following their revaluation, the NCB may return the excess assets or cash;

(c) limits in relation to the use of unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by any other entity with which that credit institution has close links as described in Article 138;

(d) valuation markdowns as laid down in Guideline (EU) 2016/65 (ECB/2015/35).

2.  The Eurosystem may apply the following additional risk control measures:

(a) initial margins, meaning that counterparties provide eligible assets with a value at least equal to the liquidity provided by the Eurosystem plus the value of the relevant initial margin;

(b) limits in relation to issuers, debtors or guarantors: the Eurosystem may apply additional limits, other than those applied to the use of unsecured debt instruments referred to in paragraph (1)(c), to the exposure vis-à-vis issuers, debtors or guarantors;

(c) supplementary haircuts;

(d) additional guarantees from guarantors meeting the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements in order to accept certain assets;

(e) the exclusion of certain assets from use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.

CHAPTER 3

Valuation rules for marketable and non-marketable assets

Article 134

Valuation rules for marketable assets

For the purposes of determining the value of assets used as collateral in open market operations conducted by means of reverse transactions, the NCBs shall apply the following rules.

(a) For each eligible marketable asset, the Eurosystem shall define the most representative price to be used for the calculation of the market value.

(b) A marketable asset's value shall be calculated on the basis of the most representative price on the business day preceding its valuation date. In the absence of a representative price for a particular asset the Eurosystem shall define a theoretical price.

(c) The market or theoretical value of a marketable asset shall be calculated including accrued interest.

(d) Depending on differences in national legal systems and operational practices, the treatment of income flows, e.g. coupon payments that are related to an asset and are received during the life of a Eurosystem credit operation, may differ between NCBs. If the income flow is transferred to the counterparty, the home NCB shall ensure that the relevant operations will still be fully covered by a sufficient amount of eligible assets before the transfer of the income takes place. Each NCB shall aim to ensure that the economic effect of the treatment of income flows is equivalent to a situation in which the income is transferred to the counterparty on the payment day.

▼M7

Article 135

Valuation rules for non-marketable assets

Non-marketable assets shall be assigned a value by the Eurosystem corresponding to the outstanding amount of such non-marketable assets.

▼B

Article 136

Margin calls

1.  Assets mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be subject to daily valuation by NCBs, in accordance with the valuation rules laid down in Articles 134 and 135. If tri-party services are used, the daily valuation process shall be delegated to the relevant TPA and shall be based on information sent by the relevant NCB to the TPA.

2.  If, after valuation and haircuts, the mobilised assets do not match the requirements as calculated on that day, margin calls shall be performed. If the value of the eligible assets mobilised as collateral by a counterparty, following their revaluation, exceeds the amount owed by the counterparty plus the variation margin, the NCB may return the excess assets or any cash that the counterparty has provided for a margin call.

3.  In order to reduce the frequency of margin calls, an NCB may apply a threshold of 0,5 % of the amount of liquidity provided. Depending on the applicable national law, if the value of the mobilised assets as collateral falls below the lower threshold, NCBs may require margin calls to be effected either through the supply of additional assets or by means of cash payments by the counterparty. Conversely, if the value of the assets used as collateral exceeds the upper threshold, the NCB may return the excess assets (or cash submitted to meet a margin call) to the counterparty.

4.  The deposit facility rate shall also apply to cash margins.



TITLE VII

ACCEPTANCE OF NON EURO-DENOMINATED COLLATERAL IN CONTINGENCIES

Article 137

Acceptance of non-euro-denominated collateral in contingencies

1.  The ECB's Governing Council may decide to accept certain marketable assets issued by non-euro area G10 central governments in their national currency as collateral. Upon such a decision by the ECB's Governing Council, counterparties shall be informed about the applicable:

(a) eligibility criteria;

(b) procedures for selection and mobilisation;

(c) sources and principles of valuation;

(d) risk control measures;

(e) settlement procedures.

▼M4

2.  The general eligibility criteria for marketable assets laid down in Title II of Part Four shall apply, except that marketable assets:

(a) may be issued, held and settled outside the EEA;

(b) may be denominated in currencies other than the euro; and

(c) shall not have a coupon value that results in a negative cash flow.

▼B

3.  Counterparties that are branches of credit institutions incorporated outside the EEA or Switzerland shall not be entitled to mobilise as collateral the marketable assets laid down in this Article.



TITLE VIII

RULES FOR THE USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS

Article 138

Close links between counterparties and the issuer, debtor or guarantor of eligible assets

1.  Irrespective of the fact that an asset is eligible, a counterparty shall not submit or use as collateral assets issued, owed or guaranteed by itself or by any other entity with which it has close links.

2.  ‘Close links’ means any of the following situations in which the counterparty and the other entity referred to in paragraph 1 are linked:

(a) the counterparty owns directly, or indirectly through one or more other undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of that other entity;

(b) that other entity owns directly, or indirectly through one or more other undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty;

(c) a third party owns, either directly or indirectly through one or more undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty and 20 % or more of the capital of the other entity.

For the purposes of assessing the existence of close links in the case of multi-cédulas, the Eurosystem shall apply a ‘look-through approach’, i.e. it shall consider close links between each of the underlying cédulas issuers and the counterparty.

3.  Paragraph 1 shall not apply with respect to any of the following:

▼M4

(a) close links between the counterparty and an EEA public sector entity that has the right to levy taxes, or cases where a debt instrument is guaranteed by one or more EEA public sector entities that have the right to levy taxes and the relevant guarantee complies with the features laid down in Article 114, subject in all cases to Article 139(1);

▼M7

(b) covered bonds meeting the requirements set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. From 1 February 2020, such covered bonds must have an ECAI issue rating as defined in point (a) of Article 83 which fulfils the requirements of Annex IXb;

▼M6

(c) non-marketable RMBDs;

▼M6

(d)  multi-cédulas issued before 1 May 2015 where the underlying cédulas comply with the criteria set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

▼M2

Article 138a

Use of debt instruments in connection with in-kind recapitalisation with public debt instruments

Public debt instruments used in an in-kind recapitalisation of a counterparty may only be used as collateral by that counterparty or by any other counterparty which has ‘close links’, as defined in Article 138(2), to that counterparty if the Eurosystem considers that the level of market access of their issuer is adequate, also taking into account the role played by such instruments in the recapitalisation.

▼B

Article 139

Use of guaranteed unsecured debt instruments issued by a counterparty or its closely linked entity

▼M4

1.  Unsecured debt instruments issued by a counterparty or any other entity closely linked to that counterparty, as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 138, and fully guaranteed by one or several EEA public sector entities which have the right to levy taxes shall not be mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations by that counterparty either:

(a) directly; or

(b) indirectly, where they are included in a pool of covered bonds.

▼B

2.  In exceptional cases, the ECB's Governing Council may decide on temporary derogations from the restriction laid down in paragraph 1 for a maximum of three years. A request for a derogation shall be accompanied by a funding plan by the requesting counterparty that indicates the manner in which the mobilisation of the respective assets will be phased out within three years following the granting of the derogation. Such a derogation shall only be provided where the nature of the guarantee provided by one or several EEA central governments, regional governments, local authorities or other public sector entities which have the right to levy taxes complies with the requirements for guarantees laid down in Article 114.

▼M6

3.  If compliance with paragraph 1(b) needs to be verified, that is, for covered bonds, where the applicable legislation or prospectus do not exclude debt instruments referred to in paragraph 1(b) as cover pool assets and where the issuer or an entity closely linked to the issuer has issued such debt instruments NCBs may take all or some of the following measures to conduct ad hoc checks of compliance with paragraph 1(b).

(a) NCBs may obtain regular surveillance reports providing an overview of assets in the cover pool of covered bonds;

(b) If surveillance reports do not provide sufficient information for verification purposes, NCBs may obtain a self-certification and undertaking of the counterparty mobilising a covered bond potentially in breach of paragraph 1(b) by which the counterparty shall confirm that the cover pool of covered bonds does not include unsecured bank bonds benefiting from a government guarantee issued by the counterparty, or a closely linked entity thereof, that is mobilising the covered bond in breach of paragraph 1(b). The counterparty's self-certification must be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on their behalf.

(c) On an annual basis, NCBs may obtain from the counterparty mobilising a covered bond potentially in breach of paragraph 1(b) an ex post confirmation by external auditors or cover pool monitors that the cover pool of covered bonds does not include unsecured bank bonds benefiting from a government guarantee issued by the counterparty, or a closely linked entity thereof, that is mobilising the covered bond in breach of paragraph 1(b).

4.  If the counterparty does not provide the self-certification and confirmation in accordance with paragraph 3 upon request from the NCB, the covered bond shall not be mobilised as collateral by that counterparty, in accordance with paragraph 1.

▼B

Article 140

Close links with respect to asset-backed securities and currency hedges

A counterparty may not mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the counterparty, or any entity with which it has close links, as laid down in Article 138, provides a currency hedge to the asset-backed securities by entering into a currency hedge transaction with the issuer as a hedge counterparty.

▼M6

Article 141

Limits with respect to unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions and their closely linked entities

1.  A counterparty shall not submit or use as collateral unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by any other entity with which that credit institution has close links, to the extent that the value of such collateral issued by that credit institution or other entity with which it has close links taken together exceeds 2,5 % of the total value of the assets used as collateral by that counterparty after the applicable haircut. This threshold shall not apply in the following cases:

(a) if the value of such assets does not exceed EUR 50 million after any applicable haircut;

(b) if such assets are guaranteed by a public sector entity which has the right to levy taxes by way of a guarantee that complies with the features laid down in Article 114; or

▼M7

(c) if such assets are issued by an agency, a multilateral development bank or an international organisation.

▼M6

2.  If a close link is established or a merger takes place between two or more issuers of unsecured debt instruments, the threshold in paragraph 1 shall apply from six months after the date on which the close link is established or the merger becomes effective.

3.  For the purposes of this Article, ‘close links’ between an issuing entity and another entity has the same meaning as ‘close links’ between a counterparty and another entity, as referred to in Article 138.

▼B

Article 142

Liquidity support in respect of asset-backed securities

1.  With effect from 1 November 2015, a counterparty may not mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the counterparty or any entity with which it has close links provides liquidity support as specified below. The Eurosystem takes into account two forms of liquidity support for asset-backed securities: cash reserves and liquidity facilities.

2.  For liquidity support in the form of cash reserves, a counterparty shall not be permitted to mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the following three conditions are met simultaneously:

3.  For liquidity support in the form of liquidity facilities, a counterparty shall not be permitted to mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the following two conditions are met simultaneously:

(a) the counterparty has close links with a liquidity facility provider; and

(b) the current amount of the liquidity facility of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 20 % of the initial outstanding amount of all senior and subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction.

Article 144

Non-acceptance of eligible assets for operational reasons

Irrespective of the fact that an asset is eligible, an NCB may, for operational reasons, request the counterparty to remove such asset before the occurrence of a cash flow, including payment of principal or coupons, as further defined in the relevant national documentation.

▼M4

Article 144a

Eligible assets with negative cash flows

1.  NCBs shall provide that a counterparty shall remain liable for the timely payment of any amount of negative cash flows related to eligible assets submitted or used by it as collateral.

2.  If a counterparty fails to effect timely payment pursuant to paragraph 1, the Eurosystem may, but is not obliged to, discharge the relevant payment. NCBs shall provide that a counterparty shall refund the Eurosystem, immediately upon request from the Eurosystem, of any amount of negative cash flows paid by the Eurosystem as a result of the counterparty's failure. If a counterparty fails to make a timely payment pursuant to paragraph 1, the Eurosystem shall have the right to debit immediately and without prior notification an amount equal to the amount the Eurosystem has to pay on behalf of such counterparty either from:

(a) the relevant counterparty's payment module (PM) account in TARGET2, as provided for in Article 36(6) of Annex II to Guideline ECB/2012/27; or

(b) with the prior authorisation of a settlement bank, the TARGET2 PM account of a settlement bank, used for the relevant counterparty's Eurosystem credit operations; or

(c) any other account that can be used for Eurosystem monetary policy operations and that the relevant counterparty has with the NCB,

3.  Any amount paid by the Eurosystem under paragraph 2 that is not refunded by a counterparty immediately upon request and that cannot be debited by the Eurosystem from any relevant account as provided for under paragraph 2, shall be considered as a credit from the Eurosystem, for which a sanction is applicable in accordance with Article 154.

▼B

Article 145

Notification, valuation and removal of assets that are ineligible or contravene the rules for the use of eligible assets

1.  If a counterparty has submitted or used assets that it is not or is no longer permitted to use as collateral, including due to the identity of the issuer, debtor or guarantor, or the existence of close links, it shall immediately notify the home NCB thereof.

2.  The assets referred to in paragraph 1 shall be valued at zero on the next valuation date at the latest and a margin call may be triggered.

3.  A counterparty that has submitted or used any assets referred to in paragraph 1 shall remove such assets on the earliest possible date.

4.  A counterparty shall provide the Eurosystem with accurate and up-to-date information affecting the value of collateral.

Article 146

Sanctions for non-compliance with the rules for the use of eligible assets

Non-compliance with the rules laid down in this Title shall be subject to sanctions, as applicable, in accordance with Articles 154 to 157. Sanctions shall be applicable, regardless of whether a counterparty is actively participating in monetary policy operations.

Article 147

Information sharing within the Eurosystem

For monetary policy implementation purposes, in particular to monitor compliance with the rules for the use of eligible assets, the Eurosystem shall share information on capital holdings provided by the competent authority for such purposes.

TITLE IX

CROSS-BORDER USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS

▼M3

Article 148

General principles

1.  Counterparties may use eligible assets on a cross-border basis throughout the euro area for all types of Eurosystem credit operations.

2.  Counterparties may mobilise eligible assets other than fixed-term deposits, for cross-border use in accordance with the following:

▼M6

(a) marketable assets shall be mobilised via one of the following: (i) eligible links; (ii) applicable CCBM procedures; (iii) eligible links in combination with the CCBM; and

▼M3

(b) credit claims, DECCs and RMBDs shall be mobilised in accordance with applicable CCBM procedures.

3.  Marketable assets may be used through an NCB account in an SSS located in a country other than that of the NCB in question if the Eurosystem has approved the use of such an account.

4.  De Nederlandsche Bank shall be authorised to use its account with Euroclear Bank to settle collateral transactions in Eurobonds issued in that ICSD. The Central Bank of Ireland shall be authorised to open a similar account with Euroclear Bank. This account can be used for all eligible assets held in Euroclear Bank, i.e. including eligible assets transferred to Euroclear Bank through eligible links.

▼M6

5.  Counterparties shall execute the transfer of eligible assets via their securities settlement accounts with an eligible SSS.

6.  A counterparty that does not have a safe custody account with an NCB or a securities settlement account with an eligible SSS may settle transactions through the securities settlement account or the safe custody account of a correspondent credit institution.

▼B

Article 149

CCBM

1.  Under the CCBM, the cross-border relationship is between the NCBs. The NCBs acts as custodians (hereinafter the ‘correspondents’) for each other and for the ECB in respect of marketable assets accepted in their local depository, TPA or settlement system. Specific procedures apply under the CCBM for credit claims and RMBDs. Details on the CCBM and the applicable procedures are set out in Annex VI and in the brochure entitled ‘Correspondent central banking model (CCBM) procedure for Eurosystem counterparties’, which is published on the ECB's website.

2.  Assets deposited with a correspondent central bank shall only be used to collateralise Eurosystem credit operations.

▼M6

Article 150

Eligible links between SSSs

1.  In addition to the CCBM, counterparties may use eligible links for the cross-border transfer of marketable assets. The ECB shall publish the list of eligible links on its website.

2.  Assets held through an eligible link may be used for Eurosystem credit operations, as well as for any other purpose selected by the counterparty.

3.  The rules on the use of eligible links are set out in Annex VI.

Article 151

CCBM in combination with eligible links

1.  Counterparties may use eligible links in combination with the CCBM to mobilise eligible marketable assets on a cross-border basis.

2.  When using eligible links between SSSs in combination with the CCBM, counterparties shall hold the assets issued in the issuer SSS in an account with an investor SSS directly or via a custodian

3.  Assets mobilised under paragraph 2 may be issued in a non-euro area EEA SSS that the Eurosystem has assessed as compliant with the eligibility criteria laid down in Annex VIa, provided that there is an eligible link between the issuer SSS and the investor SSS.

4.  The rules on the use of the CCBM in combination with eligible links are set out in Annex VI.

▼B

Article 152

CCBM and tri-party collateral management services

1.  Cross-border tri-party collateral management services shall allow a counterparty to increase or decrease the amount of collateral which it mobilises with its home NCB, through recourse to collateral held with a TPA.

▼M6

2.  The CCBM (including the CCBM in combination with eligible links) may be used as a basis for the cross-border use of tri-party collateral management services. Cross-border use of tri-party collateral management services shall involve an NCB, where tri-party collateral management services are offered for cross-border Eurosystem use, acting as a correspondent for NCBs whose counterparties have requested to use such tri-party collateral management services on a cross-border basis for the purposes of Eurosystem credit operations.

In order to provide its tri-party collateral management services for cross-border use by the Eurosystem in accordance with the first subparagraph, the relevant TPA shall comply with the set of additional functional requirements laid down by the Eurosystem, as referred to in the ‘Correspondent central banking model (CCBM) – Procedures for Eurosystem counterparties’ (Section 2.1.3, second paragraph).

▼B

3.  A table detailing the use of CCBM with tri-party collateral management services is laid down in Annex VI.

SANCTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS

Article 153

Sanctions for non-compliance as regards minimum reserves

1.  The ECB shall impose sanctions pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2532/98, Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999 (ECB/1999/4), Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 or Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) on institutions which do not comply with obligations arising from ECB regulations and decisions relating to the application of minimum reserves. The relevant sanctions and procedural rules for their application are specified in those regulations.

2.  Without prejudice to paragraph 1, in the event of a serious infringement of the minimum reserve requirements, the Eurosystem may suspend a counterparty's participation in open market operations.

Article 154

Sanctions for non-compliance with certain operational rules

1.  In accordance with the provisions of the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by it, the NCB shall impose one or more sanctions if a counterparty fails to comply with any of the following obligations:

▼M4

(a) as regards reverse transactions and foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes, the obligations, as laid down in Article 15, to adequately collateralise and settle the amount the counterparty has been allotted over the whole term of a particular operation including any outstanding amount of a particular operation in the case of early termination executed by the NCB over the remaining term of an operation;

▼B

(b) as regards collection of fixed-term deposits, outright transactions and the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the obligation to settle the transaction, as laid down in Article 16;

(c) as regards the use of eligible assets, the obligation to mobilise or use only eligible assets and comply with the rules for the use of eligible assets in Title VIII of Part Four;

(d) as regards end-of-day procedures and access conditions for the marginal lending facility, the obligation to present sufficient eligible assets in advance as collateral in cases where there is any remaining negative balance on a counterparty's settlement account in TARGET2 after finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures and an automatic request for recourse to the marginal lending facility is therefore considered to arise, as laid down in Article 19(6);

▼M4

(e) any payment obligations pursuant to Article 144a(3).

▼B

2.  A sanction imposed pursuant to this Article shall involve:

(a) a financial penalty only; or

(b) both a financial penalty and a non-financial penalty.

Article 155

Financial penalties for non-compliance with certain operational rules

If a counterparty fails to comply with any of the obligations referred to in Article 154(1), the Eurosystem shall impose a financial penalty for each case of non-compliance. The applicable financial penalty shall be calculated in accordance with Annex VII.

Article 156

Non-financial penalties for non-compliance with certain operational rules

1.  If a counterparty fails to comply with an obligation referred to in either Article 154(1)(a) or (b) on more than two occasions in a 12-month period and in respect of each failure:

▼M4

(a) a financial penalty was imposed;

▼B

(b) each decision to impose a financial penalty was notified to the counterparty;

(c) each occasion of non-compliance relates to the same type of non-compliance,

the Eurosystem shall suspend the counterparty on the occasion of the third failure and each such subsequent failure to comply with an obligation of that same type in the relevant 12-month period. The 12-month period shall be calculated from the date of the first failure to comply with an obligation referred to in either Article 154(1)(a) or (b), as applicable.

2.  Any suspension imposed by the Eurosystem under paragraph 1 shall apply in respect of any subsequent open market operation which is of the same type as the open market operation which resulted in a sanction under paragraph 1.

3.  The period of suspension imposed in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with Annex VII.

▼M6

4.  If a counterparty fails to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c) on more than two occasions in a 12-month period and in respect of each failure:

(a) a financial penalty was limposed;

(b) each decision to impose a financial penalty was notified to the counterparty;

(c) each occasion of non-compliance relates to the same type of non-compliance,

the Eurosystem shall, on the occasion of the third failure to comply, suspend the counterparty from the first liquidity-providing open market operation within the reserve maintenance period following the notification of the suspension.

If subsequently the counterparty again fails to comply, it shall be suspended from the first liquidity-providing open market operation within the reserve maintenance period following notification of suspension until a 12-month period lapses without any further such failure on the part of the counterparty.

Each 12-month period shall be calculated from the date of the notification of a sanction for failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c). Second and third breaches committed within 12 months from that notification will be taken into account.

▼B

5.  In exceptional cases, the Eurosystem may suspend a counterparty for a period of three months in respect of all future Eurosystem monetary policy operations for any failure to comply with any of the obligations laid down in Article 154(1). In such a case, the Eurosystem shall have regard to the seriousness of the case and, in particular, to the amounts involved and to the frequency and duration of non-compliance.

6.  The period of suspension imposed by the Eurosystem pursuant to this Article shall be applied in addition to the relevant financial penalty applicable in accordance with Article 155.

Article 157

Application of non-financial penalties to branches for non-compliance with certain operational rules

When the Eurosystem suspends a counterparty in accordance with Article 156(5), that suspension may also be applied to branches of that counterparty established in other Member States whose currency is the euro.



PART SIX

DISCRETIONARY MEASURES

▼M2

Article 158

Discretionary measures on the grounds of prudence or following an event of default

1.  On the grounds of prudence, the Eurosystem may take any of the following measures:

(a) suspend, limit or exclude a counterparty's access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations, pursuant to any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by its home NCB or by the ECB;

(b) reject, limit the use of or apply supplementary haircuts to assets mobilised as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations by a specific counterparty on the basis of any information the Eurosystem considers relevant, in particular if the credit quality of the counterparty appears to exhibit a high correlation with the credit quality of the assets mobilised as collateral.

2.  Counterparties that are subject to supervision as referred to in Article 55(b)(i) but which do not meet the own funds requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, on an individual and/or consolidated basis, in accordance with the supervisory requirements, and counterparties that are subject to supervision of a comparable standard as referred to in Article 55(b)(iii) but which do not meet requirements comparable to the own funds requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, on an individual and/or consolidated basis, shall be suspended, limited or excluded from accessing Eurosystem monetary policy operations on the grounds of prudence. There is an exception for cases where the Eurosystem considers that compliance can be restored through adequate and timely recapitalisation measures, as established by the Governing Council.

3.  In the context of its assessment of financial soundness of a counterparty pursuant to Article 55(c) and without prejudice to any other discretionary measures, the Eurosystem may suspend, limit or exclude, on the grounds of prudence, access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations by the following counterparties:

(a) counterparties for which information on capital ratios under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is not made available to the relevant NCB and the ECB in a timely manner and at the latest within 14 weeks from the end of the relevant quarter;

(b) counterparties which are not required to report capital ratios under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 but for which information of a comparable standard as referred to in Article 55(b)(iii) is not made available to the relevant NCB and the ECB in a timely manner and at the latest within 14 weeks from the end of the relevant quarter.

In the event that the access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations has been suspended, limited or excluded, access may be restored once the relevant information has been made available to the relevant NCB and the ECB and the Eurosystem determines that the counterparty fulfils the criterion of financial soundness pursuant to Article 55(c).

▼M6

3a.  The Eurosystem may suspend, limit or exclude, on the grounds of prudence, access to monetary policy operations by counterparties that channel Eurosystem liquidity to another entity that belongs to the same banking ‘group’ (as defined in point (26) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU and point (11) of Article 2 of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 14 )) where the entity receiving such liquidity is (i) a non-eligible wind-down entity or (ii) subject to a discretionary measure on the grounds of prudence.

4.  Without prejudice to any other discretionary measures, the Eurosystem shall, on the grounds of prudence, limit access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations by counterparties deemed to be ‘failing or likely to fail’ by the relevant authorities based on the conditions laid down in Article 18(4)(a) to (d) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 or laid down in national legislation implementing Article 32(4)(a) to (d) of Directive 2014/59/EU. The limitation shall correspond to the level of access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations prevailing at the time when such counterparties are deemed to be ‘failing or likely to fail’. The NCBs shall ensure by means of their contractual or regulatory arrangements that the limitation of access is automatic vis-à-vis the relevant counterparty, without necessitating a specific decision, and that the limitation of access is effective on the day following the day on which the relevant authorities deemed the relevant counterparty ‘failing or likely to fail’. This limitation is without prejudice to any further discretionary measures that the Eurosystem may take.

▼M2

5.  In addition to limiting access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations under paragraph 4, the Eurosystem may, on the grounds of prudence, suspend, further limit or exclude counterparties from accessing Eurosystem monetary policy operations if they are deemed to be ‘failing or likely to fail’ under paragraph 4 and they meet any of the following:

(a) are not made subject to a resolution action by the resolution authority because there are reasonable prospects that an alternative private sector measure or supervisory action, as referred to in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 and national legislation implementing Article 32(1)(b) of Directive 2014/59/EU, would prevent the failure of the institution within a reasonable timeframe, in view of the development of the alternative private sector measure or supervisory action;

(b) are assessed as meeting the conditions for resolution pursuant to Article 18(1) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 or national legislation implementing Article 32(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU, in view of the development of the resolution action;

(c) result from a resolution action as defined under Article 3(10) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 and national legislation implementing Article 2(40) of Directive 2014/59/EU or from an alternative private sector measure or supervisory action as referred to in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 and national legislation implementing Article 32(1)(b) of Directive 2014/59/EU.

6.  Beyond a limitation of access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations pursuant to paragraph 4, the Eurosystem shall suspend, further limit or exclude from access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations on the grounds of prudence counterparties which have been deemed to be ‘failing or likely to fail’ but for which neither a resolution action has been provided for, nor are there reasonable prospects that an alternative private sector measure or supervisory action would prevent the failure of the institution within a reasonable time-frame as referred to in Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 and national legislation implementing Article 32(1)(b) of Directive 2014/59/EU.

7.  In the event that a discretionary measure is based on prudential information, the Eurosystem shall use any such information, provided either by supervisors or by counterparties, in a manner strictly commensurate with, and necessary for, the performance of the Eurosystem's tasks of conducting monetary policy.

8.  In the case of an occurrence of an event of default, the Eurosystem may suspend, limit or exclude access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations with regard to counterparties that are in default pursuant to any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the Eurosystem.

9.  All discretionary measures of the Eurosystem shall be applied in a proportionate and non-discriminatory manner and shall be duly justified by the Eurosystem.

▼B

Article 159

Discretionary measures relating to the Eurosystem's credit quality assessment

1.  The Eurosystem shall determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements on the basis of any information it considers relevant.

2.  The Eurosystem may reject, limit the mobilisation or use of assets or apply supplementary haircuts on the grounds provided for in paragraph 1, if such decision is required in order to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem.

3.  In the event that a rejection as referred to in paragraph 2 is based on prudential information, the Eurosystem shall use any such information, transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors, in a manner that is strictly commensurate with, and necessary for, the performance of the Eurosystem's tasks of conducting monetary policy.

▼M6

4.  The Eurosystem may exclude the following assets from the list of eligible marketable assets:

(a) assets issued, co-issued, serviced or guaranteed by counterparties, or entities closely linked to counterparties subject to freezing of funds and/or other measures imposed by the Union under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of funds; and/or

(b) assets issued, co-issued, serviced or guaranteed by counterparties, or entities closely linked to counterparties in respect of which the ECB's Governing Council has issued a decision suspending, limiting or excluding their access to Eurosystem open market operations or standing facilities.

(a) claiming default interest; and

(b) claiming an indemnity for any losses sustained as a consequence of a default by the counterparty.

▼M6

4a.  Each NCB shall apply contractual or regulatory arrangements which ensure that, at all times, the home NCB is in a legal position to impose a financial penalty for a failure of a counterparty to reimburse or pay, in full or in part, any amount of the credit or of the repurchase price, or to deliver the purchased assets, at maturity or when otherwise due, in the event that no remedy is available to it pursuant to Article 166(2). The financial penalty shall be calculated in accordance with Annex VII, Section III, taking into account the amount of cash that the counterparty could not pay or reimburse, or the assets the counterparty could not deliver, and the number of calendar days during which the counterparty did not pay, reimburse or deliver.

(a) Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the repurchase date for each transaction shall be deemed to occur immediately and be subject to either of the following options:

(i) any equivalent margin assets shall be immediately deliverable, so that performance of respective obligations of the parties with regard to the delivery of assets and the payment of the repurchase price for any repurchased assets shall be effected only in accordance with points (b) to (d); or

(ii) the repurchase transaction will be terminated.

(c) ‘forward rate’ means the rate calculated in accordance with Article 175 and applied to convert the euro amount into such amount in the foreign currency as one party shall be obliged to transfer to the other at the retransfer date against payment of the euro amount, which rate shall be as set out in the confirmation and defined in the relevant contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB;

(d) ‘retransfer foreign currency amount’ means such amount of foreign currency as is required to purchase the euro amount as at the retransfer date;

(b) On the basis of the sums so established, the NCB shall calculate what is due from each party to the other at the retransfer date. The sums due by one party must be converted into euro where necessary in accordance with Article 175 and set off against the sums due by the other. Only the net balance shall be payable by the party having the claim thereby valued at the lower amount. Such net balance is due and payable on the next day on which TARGET2 is operational to effect such a payment.
